Major tech earnings disappointed as AI infrastructure spending concerns mounted, with **Alphabet's $185 billion capex guidance for 2026** triggering initial selling before cloud growth momentum provided support.

- Software ETF (IGV) entered bear market territory, down 30% from September highs as AI displacement fears spread beyond individual companies
- Qualcomm missed Q2 revenue guidance at $10.2-11 billion (top end below estimates) due to memory cost pressures crimping handset demand

- Memory shortages spreading from data centers to smartphones, with chips being diverted to support hyperscaler demand
