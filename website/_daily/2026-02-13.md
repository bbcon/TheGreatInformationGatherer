Markets declined on broadening AI disruption fears as concerns spread from software to logistics and financial services. January CPI data showed core inflation at 2.5% year-over-year, meeting expectations and keeping Fed rate cuts on the table. Asian markets extended losses overnight as the AI narrative reached the region, though memory chip makers outperformed on supply shortage concerns.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

January CPI provided a mixed read on the inflation outlook, with core prices rising 2.5% year-over-year in line with consensus expectations.

- Core CPI increased 0.3% month-over-month, matching forecasts
- Headline inflation decelerated to 2.4% year-over-year from 2.7% in December  
- Shelter inflation showed meaningful deceleration after pandemic-era stickiness
- Goods prices remained flat month-over-month, though tariff effects appeared in appliances (+1.3%) and computers (+3.1%)

Markets now price 58 basis points of Fed cuts by year-end, up from 40 basis points two weeks ago. The softer CPI print keeps approximately 75 basis points of cuts alive through year-end, with April, July, and September cuts as the base case scenario.

**Equities & Earnings**

Equity markets extended declines as AI disruption fears broadened beyond software into additional sectors.

- S&P 500 fell 1.6%, Nasdaq declined 2.0% in another session dominated by technology weakness
- Software ETF dropped 3% for its fifth consecutive weekly loss
- Cisco plunged 13% on margin pressure from rising DRAM costs, triggering broader hardware concerns
- Applied Materials gained 11% after hours on strong earnings, validating memory chip demand
- Financials declined 2.9% despite year-to-date gains of 11% as AI displacement fears spread to the sector
- Energy names outperformed with WTI crude falling 2.7% to $63 on Venezuela supply optimism

Corporate earnings highlighted divergent AI impacts. Coinbase reported Q4 revenue of $1.78 billion versus $1.83 billion expected, though institutional and stablecoin growth accelerated 37% quarter-over-quarter.

**Fixed Income**

Treasury markets rallied as bonds performed their traditional hedge function during equity volatility.

- 10-year yields declined 7 basis points, falling below 4.10% at session lows
- 2-year yields dropped to 3.43%, the lowest level since September 2022
- 30-year auction showed record end-user demand with the lowest dealer takedown on record at 4.73%
- Credit markets remained resilient with high-yield spreads holding at 275 basis points

The bull flattening move reflected classic flight-to-safety flows, though the front end remains vulnerable to any CPI upside surprises.

**International Markets**

Asian markets declined overnight as AI disruption concerns finally reached the region after days of relative outperformance.

- Hang Seng opened down 1.1% in Hong Kong
- KOSPI fell 0.6% though Samsung rallied 6% on memory shortage concerns
- China's yuan strengthened to 6.9398 versus the dollar, marking its eighth consecutive daily gain
- Tencent declined 22% from recent highs with 14-day RSI reaching 26, the lowest since 2022

European allies pledged $35 billion in Ukraine military aid at the Munich Security Conference, highlighting continued transatlantic coordination despite growing strains.

**Commodities & FX**

Commodity markets showed signs of forced liquidation amid broader risk-off sentiment.

- Gold fell 2.8%, silver declined 7% in what appeared to be margin call-driven selling
- Bitcoin dropped 3.5% to $65,000 despite generally supportive regulatory backdrop
- Dollar remained rangebound though yen headed for its strongest week since 2024
- Oil prices reflected Venezuela production optimism with forecasts for 30-40% growth in year one post-Maduro

**Key Risks & Outlook**

The pace of AI disruption fears accelerating across sectors represents the primary near-term market risk. Memory chip shortages are pressuring hardware margins while prediction market competition intensified after DraftKings guided 2026 revenue below expectations at $6.5-6.9 billion versus $7.32 billion consensus.

Geopolitical tensions escalated with OpenAI accusing China's DeepSeek of distilling US AI models, potentially triggering additional sanctions ahead of DeepSeek's anticipated R2 model release.

Market positioning appears to have lightened significantly after three weeks of rotation, with forced unwinds across leveraged products exacerbating moves in thin liquidity conditions. The concentration of passive buyers in investment-grade credit faces growing scrutiny as technology debt issuance surges.
