DAILY BRIEF:
Geopolitical tensions dominated markets as Trump issued a 10-15 day ultimatum to Iran while deploying the largest U.S. military buildup in the Middle East since the Iraq War. Blue Owl's suspension of withdrawals from a $1.5 billion retail private credit fund reignited transparency concerns across the sector. Markets await December PCE data and a potential Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff authority.

**Geopolitical Developments**

The Trump administration escalated pressure on Iran with a mid-March military action timeline, positioning two aircraft carrier strike groups and additional fighter jets in the region. Oil markets responded with Brent crude rising to $72 per barrel, the highest level since July 2024, with analysts estimating a $5 geopolitical premium currently priced in.

- Brent crude gained 2-6% over two sessions, approaching the June 2024 peak of $79 when Iranian facilities were previously targeted
- Gulf states including UAE and Saudi Arabia warned the U.S. against using their territory or airspace for potential strikes
- Defense stocks outperformed in Japan and Korea, including Hanwa Aerospace and Kawasaki Heavy
- Gold held above $5,000 on safe-haven demand

**Markets & Positioning**

Equity markets declined despite yesterday's rebound, with the S&P 500 falling 0.6% and testing 100-day moving average support. The selloff was led by large technology names, pushing the VIX back above 20.

- S&P futures opened +0.2% but reversed lower; Nasdaq fell 0.7%
- Euro Stoxx 50 recovered early losses to close +0.5%
- Asian markets showed mixed performance with Japan's Nikkei down 1.3% on dual pressure from geopolitical concerns and Bank of Japan rate hike speculation
- Hong Kong equities underperformed with the Hang Seng declining ~1% and tech names down ~2%
- Alternative asset managers including Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone fell over 6% on contagion concerns from Blue Owl

**Private Credit Stress**

Blue Owl suspended withdrawals indefinitely from its OBDC2 fund, selling $1.4 billion in loans near par value despite marking them at a 75% NAV discount. The development highlighted potential liquidity mismatches in retail-accessible private credit vehicles.

- The fund sale occurred near par value, considered constructive for distributions but exposed duration vulnerabilities
- Broader contagion risk emerged if stress spreads across the $1.8 trillion private credit market
- Software sector exposure remains a particular concern given AI disruption fears
- Raymond James maintained Strong Buy ratings on diversified platforms, viewing the selloff as overdone

**Economic Data & Fed Policy**

Key data releases are due today including December PCE and Q4 GDP, delayed by the prior government shutdown. The personal savings rate of 3.5% remains three percentage points below pre-COVID norms, suggesting consumer stress.

- Q4 GDP expected at 2.7-2.8%, down from Bloomberg Economics' forecast of 3% due to shutdown impacts
- Super core CPI remains sticky, particularly in services including food services, accommodations, and streaming
- Fed minutes showed unexpected hawkishness with discussion of potential rate hikes, shocking consensus expectations
- A political dispute emerged between Minneapolis Fed's Kashkari and the White House over Fed independence after criticism of tariff research

**Trade & Tariffs**

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on Trump's tariff authority at 10am ET, potentially invalidating the use of International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) provisions. The administration has signaled alternative authorities if needed.

- The U.S.-China trade deficit reached its smallest level in over 20 years due to tariff impacts
- The effective U.S. import tariff rate now stands at 13.6%
- Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. nearly doubled on semiconductor and electronics exports
- Manufacturing jobs declined in 12 of 13 months since Trump's return despite tariff protections

**Currency & Rates**

The dollar gave up earlier gains for the fifth consecutive session, with the euro approaching its 50-day moving average. Treasury yields showed minimal movement ahead of the data releases.

- USD/JPY traded at 155 after five days of yen strength
- 10-year Treasury yields held at 4.07% with 30-year at 4.70%
- Record dollar short positions across EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, and AUD created potential for further squeezes
- Curve steepening risk emerged if tariffs are invalidated, potentially widening the fiscal deficit
