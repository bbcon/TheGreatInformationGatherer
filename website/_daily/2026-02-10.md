DAILY BRIEF:
TSMC's 37% January sales surge validated continued AI infrastructure demand amid broader semiconductor strength. Alphabet's $20 billion global bond issuance, including a 100-year sterling note, demonstrated strong credit appetite for AI capex financing. UK Prime Minister Starmer secured temporary cabinet support but faces fragile positioning ahead of May local elections.

**Equities & Earnings**

Asian markets extended gains to record highs, with the Asia-Pacific equity index rising 1% for a ninth consecutive session. Dollar weakness supported the regional rally as investors rotated toward attractive valuations outside US tech.

- Nikkei gained 2.8% following Takaichi's landslide election victory, fueling reflation expectations
- KOSPI delivered 54% total returns since Q4 2024, driven by AI/memory chip surge and Value Up program
- Hang Seng Tech entered bear market territory, down 6% from January peaks as rotation favored consumer names
- S&P 500 traded near all-time highs with equal-weight index at records, signaling broadening beyond concentrated tech exposure

Corporate developments highlighted AI infrastructure momentum despite sector rotation concerns. TSMC's January sales jumped 37% year-over-year to record levels on potential US tariff exemptions for major tech firms. Memory chip shortages intensified with DRAM prices up 600% in recent months, creating constraints through 2027 but benefiting unlisted Chinese chipmakers.

**Fixed Income & Credit Markets**

Alphabet's unprecedented $20 billion global bond offering exceeded the initial $15 billion target, demonstrating robust credit appetite despite equity market skepticism around AI spending. The issuance included a 100-year sterling note with spreads at 95 basis points over Treasuries.

- Investment grade spreads reached 2007 lows as AI-related issuance approached 20% of the index
- Companies front-loaded issuance while the credit window remained open
- Leveraged loan markets showed divergence, with single-B credits struggling versus IG strength

Treasury markets showed initial volatility on reports that China urged domestic banks to reduce US Treasury holdings amid concentration risk concerns. The 10-year yield spiked 3 basis points before stabilizing, with limited sustained impact as dollar weakness continued.

**Central Banks & Policy**

Market focus remained on Kevin Warsh's Fed nomination, with concerns around potential balance sheet reduction plans and Treasury-Fed coordination creating bond market volatility. Fed fund futures continued pricing two rate cuts in 2026 despite Warsh's hawkish reputation.

Bank of England easing expectations increased, with a 5-4 dovish split mirroring pre-cut patterns from 2024. Inflation projections showed a Q2 return to target, supporting March cut speculation despite UK political uncertainty.

- PBOC injected liquidity through multiple tools ahead of Lunar New Year holidays
- China overnight repo volumes hit record 8.2 trillion RMB as liquidity remained abundant
- 10-year China government bond yields fell below 1.8%, the lowest since November

**Foreign Exchange**

Dollar weakness accelerated across multiple sessions, supporting emerging market currencies and commodity exporters. The Dollar Index posted sharp declines as investors positioned for potential Fed policy shifts.

- USD/CNY approached 6.90, near 2023 highs, as PBOC allowed appreciation
- EUR/JPY traded near January 2022 peaks amid shifting carry trade dynamics
- Sterling showed vulnerability on crosses, particularly GBP/EUR and GBP/CHF, due to UK political risk

**Political & Geopolitical Developments**

UK political uncertainty persisted despite PM Starmer's temporary reprieve from cabinet support and defiant speech to MPs. His position remained fragile ahead of May 7 local elections, with the Gorton/Denton by-election in two weeks showing Greens favored and Labour distant third.

- Parliament voted to release all Mandelson-government communications despite PM objections
- Options markets positioned for post-election volatility as political risk premium persisted
- China-Japan tensions escalated as Beijing demanded Takaichi retract Taiwan comments

**Economic Data & Outlook**

Regional growth momentum built across Asia-Pacific, with Taiwan GDP forecasts upgraded to 8% from 4.5% on semiconductor demand and Singapore GDP projections raised to 2-4%. US retail sales data due later today represented a key test for consumer strength amid the ongoing rotation trade from concentrated tech positions.

Target announced 500 job cuts following 1,800 corporate role reductions as part of restructuring under new CEO leadership. The moves reflected broader corporate cost discipline despite generally strong earnings momentum.
