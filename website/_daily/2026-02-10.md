Asia-Pacific equities hit record highs as dollar weakness accelerated and TSMC's 37% January sales surge validated continued AI infrastructure demand, overshadowing UK political uncertainty around PM Starmer's fragile position.

**Equities & AI Infrastructure**

Markets continued rotating toward Asia and away from concentrated US tech exposure, with the Asia-Pacific equity index gaining 1% to record highs for a ninth consecutive session.

- TSMC January sales surged 37% YoY to record levels on potential US tariff exemptions for major tech firms
- Nikkei gained 2.8% as PM Ishiba's election landslide fueled reflation expectations
- KOSPI delivered 54% total returns since Q4 2024, driven by AI/memory chip demand and Value Up program
- Taiwan GDP forecast upgraded to 8% from 4.5% (BofA) on semiconductor strength
- S&P 500 equal-weight index reached records, signaling rally broadening beyond mega-cap tech

AI corporate financing remained robust despite equity skepticism. Alphabet raised $20 billion in global bond markets versus a $15 billion target, including a 100-year sterling note, with spreads at 95bps over Treasuries despite tight credit conditions. Oracle also saw oversubscribed issuance as AI-related investment grade debt approached 20% of the index.

**Central Banks & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve faced scrutiny over Kevin Warsh's potential appointment, with markets concerned about balance sheet reduction plans and Treasury coordination that could create bond volatility. Fed pricing remained unchanged at two rate cuts for 2026 despite Warsh's hawkish reputation.

- BoE March rate cut increasingly likely on 5-4 dovish split patterns and Q2 inflation target projections
- PBOC injected liquidity via multiple tools ahead of Lunar New Year, with 10-year CGB yields below 1.8%
- China overnight repo volume hit record 8.2 trillion RMB as authorities ensured ample liquidity

**FX & Fixed Income**

Dollar weakness accelerated across major crosses as China directed banks to reduce US Treasury holdings amid concentration risk concerns.

- USD/CNY approached 6.90, near 2023 highs, as PBOC allowed appreciation
- Dollar Index declined sharply in multi-session weakness
- EUR/JPY neared January 2022 peaks on shifting carry trade dynamics
- US Treasury 10-year yields spiked 3bps initially on China news but stabilized with limited sustained impact

UK political uncertainty pressured gilts and sterling initially, though moves moderated as PM Starmer secured temporary cabinet support despite fragility ahead of May local elections.

**Credit Markets**

Investment grade credit spreads reached 2007 lows despite heavy AI-related issuance, while leveraged loan markets showed divergence with single-B credits struggling against IG strength.

- Alphabet's $20 billion raise oversubscribed across all tranches
- AI corporate bond demand remained strong but opened CDS tail risks
- Front-loading of issuance continued while credit window remained open

**Commodities & Sector Rotation**

Memory chip shortages intensified with DRAM prices up 600% in recent months, creating supply constraints expected through 2027. Gold reversed two days of gains but held above $3,000/oz after its historic rout.

**Geopolitical Developments**

China-Japan tensions escalated as Beijing demanded PM Ishiba retract Taiwan comments and warned against constitutional reform. Ukraine ceasefire uncertainty persisted with Munich Security Conference warnings that Russian maximalist goals remained unchanged.

**Key Data Ahead**

US retail sales data due at 8:30am ET represents a critical test for consumer strength amid the ongoing rotation trade, with weak prints potentially threatening the equal-weight rally thesis. The data comes ahead of CPI and payrolls later this week.

**Corporate Developments**

Target announced 500 job cuts following 1,800 corporate role reductions as part of restructuring under its new CEO. Luxury sector showed stabilization with Kering shares surging on Gucci improvement, though Q4 revenue declined 10% as expected. Barclays reported Q4 profit of £9.1 billion, up 13% YoY, with FICC trading posting its best Q4 since 2016.

The session highlighted continued capital flow shifts toward Asia amid US fiscal concerns and AI infrastructure demand, while credit markets maintained receptivity to technology capex financing despite equity market rotation pressures.
