US jobless claims dropped to 198K, well below the 215K consensus, while manufacturing surveys rebounded sharply, underscoring labor market resilience that has prompted markets to reprice Fed rate cut expectations from seven cuts to just two in 2026.

**Labor Markets & Economic Data**

The labor market continues to show surprising strength despite Fed rate cuts, with several key indicators pointing to sustained tightness:

- Jobless claims fell to 198K versus 215K expected, marking the lowest reading in months
- Unadjusted claims declined 30K year-over-year, reinforcing the underlying strength
- Wage growth remains elevated at 4.4% for job stayers and 6.6% for job switchers, though the job-change premium has narrowed to less than 3%
- Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index surged to 12.6 from -8.8, while Empire State jumped to 7.7 from -3.7
- Retail sales posted their strongest performance since July, demonstrating continued consumer resilience

**Equities & Sector Rotation**

Small caps extended their outperformance streak to nine consecutive sessions, the longest since 2017, as investors rotated away from stretched large-cap valuations:

- Russell 2000 gained 1.2% versus S&P 500's 0.4% advance
- Equal-weight S&P 500 outperformed cap-weighted by 30 basis points
- Semiconductor stocks posted their best day since April following TSMC's robust guidance
- Applied Materials hit a €500B market cap milestone, becoming only the third European stock to reach this level

**Banking Sector Mixed Results**

Wall Street banks delivered record earnings but sold off sharply as investors questioned sustainability after 30-50% rallies in 2025:

- Goldman Sachs posted an all-time Wall Street record in equities trading revenue of $4.3B
- Morgan Stanley's wealth management division generated $8.4B, beating expectations
- Bank stocks fell 1-4% despite strong results, with investors concerned about 18% cost growth
- BlackRock reached $14T in assets under management, posting its best day since April

**TSMC Drives AI Infrastructure Optimism**

Taiwan Semiconductor's earnings and guidance reinforced the structural nature of AI demand, lifting chip equipment stocks:

- TSMC guided for 30% revenue growth in 2026 with capex of $52-56B, well above the $40-60B expected range
- The company expects tight supply conditions to persist through mid-2028
- Management's bullish outlook extends the AI infrastructure cycle timeline through 2029
- Entegris, Applied Materials, and KLA rallied on the semiconductor capital equipment implications

**Energy & Commodities**

Oil prices plunged as geopolitical risk premiums unwound following reports of delayed Iran strikes:

- WTI crude fell 4.5% to $59.50, breaking below the $60 psychological level
- Silver declined 4% from recent $94K peaks to around $90K as critical minerals tariff implementation was delayed
- Energy stocks present a contrarian opportunity at just 2.9% of S&P 500 weighting, the lowest since 2020

**Fed Independence Under Scrutiny**

Political pressure on Fed leadership intensified despite strong economic data supporting fewer rate cuts:

- Trump stated he has "no plans to fire" Powell but the DOJ investigation continues
- Former Treasury Secretaries and Fed chairs signed a letter defending Powell's independence
- GOP pushback is intensifying, with Senator Tillis threatening to block Fed nominees until the probe is resolved
- Markets have repriced from seven rate cuts to just two in 2026 following the strong economic data

**Central Bank Divergence**

Global central bank policy paths are diverging as regional economic conditions vary:

- Bank of Korea held rates and removed easing bias, with five of six members seeing holds likely over the next three months
- ECB still expected to deliver four more cuts despite some calling for rate hikes
- Fed policy uncertainty remains elevated as political pressure mounts alongside resilient economic data

**Market Outlook**

The disconnect between strong macro data and investor sentiment continues to define market dynamics. With labor markets tight, manufacturing rebounding, and consumer spending resilient, the case for aggressive Fed easing has weakened considerably. Small-cap outperformance reflects investor rotation toward cheaper valuations after large-cap tech's extended run, while TSMC's guidance reinforces the structural AI investment theme extending well into the decade.
