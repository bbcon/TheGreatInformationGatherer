**Silver hit fresh records above $90 while small caps extended their longest outperformance streak since 1990, as banks tumbled despite earnings beats and geopolitical tensions eased with Trump's Iran de-escalation comments.**

**Equities & Earnings**

The S&P 500 fell 0.5% for its second consecutive decline, with Microsoft, Amazon, Broadcom, and Nvidia accounting for 50% of the two-day drop as tech rotation accelerated. The Russell 2000 bucked the trend with a 0.7% gain, marking its ninth straight day of outperformance versus the S&P 500—the longest streak since 1990. The NASDAQ 100 dropped 1.5% as investors rotated out of mega-cap technology.

Bank earnings disappointed despite revenue beats, with Bank of America falling 4%, Wells Fargo down 4.6%, and Citigroup declining 3.3%. BofA beat on net interest income at $15.75 billion versus $15.48 billion expected and added 3.8 million credit card accounts, while Citi saw investment banking fees surge 84%. However, investors focused on rising expense guidance across the sector and concerns about NII trajectory despite Fed cuts expected to lift NII into 2026.

**TSMC delivered blowout capex guidance of $52-56 billion for 2026, roughly 70% above consensus expectations of $40-60 billion, signaling the AI infrastructure boom extends structurally through 2028. The semiconductor giant reported 30% revenue growth and indicated tight supply conditions would persist until mid-2028.**

**Commodities & Precious Metals**

Silver surged to new record highs above $90 per ounce, up 3.6%, driven by physical scarcity in London as US tariff hoarding created supply constraints. Gold, tin, copper, and aluminum all hit fresh records on the debasement trade narrative and AI/data center demand. The precious metals rally accelerated amid Fed independence concerns and geopolitical risks.

WTI crude fell 2% to around $59.50 after Trump suggested Iran violence had stopped, though the claims remained unverified. Oil had rallied for four straight days in its biggest gain in over six months before the reversal on geopolitical premium unwinding.

**Economic Data & Labor Markets**

November retail sales rose modestly but October figures were revised downward, with strength concentrated among wealthier consumers rather than broad-based demand. Wholesale inflation (PPI) picked up as energy costs rose, complicating the disinflation narrative with core PPI ex-food, energy, and trade at 3.5% year-over-year—the largest increase since March.

Small business optimism improved for current conditions but sales expectations declined. Twelve percent of small businesses cited inflation as their top problem, down from peak levels, while 20% still identified labor quality as their primary concern. Hiring plans showed signs of softening despite recent productivity improvements potentially linked to AI adoption.

The unemployment rate has risen 0.4% annually for three consecutive years, signaling gradual labor market weakening that continues to concern policymakers.

**Central Banks & Monetary Policy**

Fed independence concerns escalated after weekend comments from Powell, prompting Senate Republicans to publicly support central bank autonomy. Foreign central bank chiefs from the RBI, ECB, and Bank of Latvia expressed concern about threats to Fed independence. Markets are pricing just over two cuts in 2026, with the first appearing certain but subsequent moves uncertain.

The Bank of Korea held rates and removed "room for cuts" language, signaling the end of its easing cycle with five of six members expecting holds over the next three months. The central bank cited FX volatility, household debt, and Seoul home prices as key concerns.

Trump said he has "no plan to remove Powell" but may announce his Fed chair decision "in a few weeks," calling the current chair "lousy" and "too late" on cuts.

**Policy & Geopolitical Developments**

Trump's proposed 10% credit card interest rate cap drew universal criticism from banks, who warned it would restrict credit access for those who need it most and negatively impact economic growth. The proposal would represent a 50% haircut to current bank rates, threatening significant revenue streams.

**China tightened margin financing requirements from 100% to 80% collateral ratio to cool its overheating equity rally, though Morgan Stanley expects minimal disruption to the bull market.** Chinese daily turnover hit a record 4 trillion RMB with margin debt at all-time peaks. Trip.com plunged 20% on an antitrust probe as regulators intensified scrutiny of platform monopolies ahead of Lunar New Year.

The Supreme Court delayed its ruling on USTR tariff legality, disappointing apparel stocks which suffered their worst day since mid-September. Sixty-four percent of small businesses report supply chain issues, with the apparel sector hit hardest by tariff uncertainty.

**Market Positioning & Outlook**

The VIX elevated to 16 in its most meaningful move higher since November, while 10-year Treasury yields fell 4 basis points in their biggest one-day drop since late November. The dollar declined slightly despite geopolitical noise.

Small caps gained momentum in minerals, defense, and space sectors, with positioning no longer extreme as hedge fund shorts closed and turned net long. However, questions remain about rotation sustainability after multiple false starts, particularly given Mag 7 concentration still driving index moves.

Private credit continues attracting institutional interest with 8-9% yields, as 56% of advisors use the asset class and 69% are increasing allocations despite headline defaults concerns that remain statistically low.
