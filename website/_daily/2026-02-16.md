DAILY BRIEF:
Asian markets traded cautiously as China entered Lunar New Year holidays with mounting earnings concerns. Japan's GDP miss raised questions about BOJ normalization timing despite continued yen strength. US markets maintained rate cut expectations despite strong growth data creating a fundamental disconnect.

**Macro Data & Central Banks**

US economic conditions remained robust with GDP nowcast at 3.6% and core inflation at 2.5%, yet markets continued pricing three Fed cuts for 2025. Core PCE data due Friday is expected to show continued progress toward the 2% target, with the month-on-month reading anticipated at 0.2%. The disconnect between strong fundamentals and dovish market pricing reflects political and structural factors, including ongoing dollar diversification trends.

Japan's Q4 GDP disappointed sharply, registering just 0.2% annualized growth versus 1.6% expected. Consumer spending slowed to 0.1% while net exports provided no contribution despite monthly export gains. The miss raised questions about the BOJ's normalization timeline, though wage growth trajectory remains supportive of an April rate hike over March 19. Markets are pricing two BOJ hikes for 2025 with politicians not pushing back against tightening expectations.

- Taiwan upgraded 2025 GDP outlook to 7.71% from 3.54% on AI boom optimism
- Thailand Q4 GDP beat at 1.9%, full year 2.4% above estimates
- UK CPI due Wednesday expected at 3.0% versus 3.4% prior

**Equities & Earnings**

Chinese platform stocks faced dual pressure from regulatory scrutiny and brief Pentagon list confusion. The Hang Seng declined approximately 1% with Alibaba falling 2% after regulatory summons over "involutionary" pricing practices and temporary inclusion on a Pentagon military-linked list that was later retracted. Meituan faced pressure on $3.5 billion loss warnings as Beijing's anti-involution drive intensifies.

China earnings season presents structural headwinds with negative pre-announcements outnumbering positive by 15% versus 4.8% in Q2. The bifurcation in Asian performance remains stark: Korea up 31% year-to-date, Taiwan up 16%, while MSCI China shows less than 1% gains.

- Hang Seng Index adding CATL, Zijin Mining, Lapu Gold on March 9
- Goldman estimates $8 billion in passive inflows from index changes
- Japanese financials fell 3% on GDP miss reducing BOJ hike expectations

**Currency & Rates**

The yen continued strengthening, testing the 153 handle from recent levels near 159, supported by post-election political stability narratives and market confidence in BOJ normalization. US 2-year yields hit 3.5-year lows at September 2022 levels on cooler inflation expectations.

Emerging market currencies outperformed developed market peers on Fed easing bias and ex-US growth data holding up better than US metrics. The combination of lower volatility and less crowded positioning compared to Magnificent Seven stocks supported EM FX flows.

**Commodities & Credit**

Gold topped $5,000 per ounce before pulling back, maintaining elevated levels on geopolitical premiums. Credit derivative volatility has increased, particularly around hyperscaler debt issuance for AI capital expenditure, creating monitoring opportunities in CDS markets.

**Geopolitics & Policy**

The Pentagon's brief inclusion of Alibaba, BYD, and other Chinese companies on a military-linked list before retracting the entire roster created confusion ahead of the expected Trump-Xi meeting in early April. Both sides appear focused on formalizing tariff truce arrangements and addressing second-tier issues.

Secretary of State Rubio offered conciliatory tones at the Munich Security Conference while maintaining unchanged substance on European burden-sharing expectations. Iran-Israel negotiations in Geneva remain scheduled with Netanyahu demanding zero enrichment capability while Iran signals flexibility on enrichment levels contingent on sanctions relief.

**Technology Disruption**

AI disruption accelerated across multiple sectors, with ByteDance's Doubao upgrade and Seaweed 2.0 video model launch demonstrating commercial-quality capabilities. The "SaaS apocalypse" continues hitting software, logistics, and wealth management as coding costs plummet, though Fortune 500 migration timelines suggest near-term impacts may be overblown while structural margin concerns remain valid.

Chinese AI video models including KlingAI are reaching monetization thresholds, with Kuaishou's platform already matching China revenue in US markets, signaling accelerated business model disruption for traditional Hollywood and media companies.

The memory bottleneck in AI infrastructure remains visible, supporting Korea's outperformance at the intersection of AI demand and cyclical recovery, while enterprise AI adoption continues its early stages despite supply-side disruptions.
