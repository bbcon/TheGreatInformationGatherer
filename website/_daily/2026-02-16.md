US core inflation cooled to 2.5% in January, below expectations and supporting market pricing for Fed cuts in June or July despite robust 3.6% GDP nowcast data. Asian markets traded cautiously amid China's deepening earnings recession, with platforms facing regulatory pressure over pricing wars. Japan's GDP disappointed sharply, pressuring the yen and BOJ normalization timeline.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The January core CPI reading of 2.5% came in below consensus, reinforcing market expectations for Fed easing despite strong economic growth indicators. The 3.6% GDP nowcast suggests the economy may not require cyclical stimulus, creating a disconnect between data and policy expectations.

- 2-year Treasury yields fell to 3.5-year lows, matching September 2022 levels
- Markets pricing June/July Fed cuts, driven more by structural dollar diversification than economic necessity
- Political and structural factors appear to outweigh traditional economic considerations in policy expectations

**Asia-Pacific Economic Data**

Japan delivered the most significant data disappointment, with Q4 GDP growing just 0.2% annualized versus 1.6% consensus expectations.

- Consumer spending decelerated sharply to 0.1% growth
- GDP miss raises questions about BOJ hiking timeline, though spring wage negotiations remain the key catalyst
- Market still expects two BOJ hikes in 2026, with April now appearing more likely than March

Taiwan provided a stark contrast with dramatically upgraded 2026 GDP outlook of 7.71%, more than doubling from the previous 3.54% forecast.

- Upgrade driven by AI boom optimism and US trade deal benefits  
- Export growth projections raised to 22% from 6%
- Thailand's Q4 GDP of 2.4% also beat estimates

**China Developments**

China faces mounting headwinds as earnings recession intensifies and regulatory pressure on platforms escalates. Authorities summoned major platforms over pricing wars, while Meituan warned of $3.5 billion annual losses.

- Negative earnings alerts now outnumber positive by 15%, up from 4.8% in Q2
- Margin compression accelerating despite regulatory crackdown on price competition
- Trade surplus reached record levels despite US tariffs, highlighting rebalancing challenges
- USD/CNH held steady at 6.90, anchored by policy support for RMB internationalization

Friday's confusion over Pentagon Section 126H list additions briefly included Alibaba, BYD, and JD before being retracted, raising questions about intentional signaling ahead of the April Trump-Xi summit versus administrative error.

**Equity Markets**

MSCI China tested its 200-day moving average for the first time since April, reflecting weakening momentum from September highs amid holiday-thinned volumes.

- Hang Seng mixed with Alibaba down 2%, Meituan and JD pressured by regulatory concerns
- Index additions include CL, Semok, and Lapu Gold effective March 9
- Nikkei fell 0.1% with Japanese banks declining 3% following the GDP miss

**Currency & Commodities**

USD/JPY retreated to 153 from 159 levels as the yen rallied on reduced fiscal slippage concerns following the LDP's supermajority. However, volatility remains elevated given ongoing policy uncertainty.

Gold extended gains above $5,000, posting mid-teens returns year-to-date as central banks continue diversification away from dollar exposure. Silver trading remains more speculative in nature.

**Emerging Market Dynamics**

EM currencies have shown remarkable stability despite Fed policy uncertainty, driven by ex-US data surprises outpacing US performance and broad easing bias globally.

- This week brings rate decisions from RBNZ, BSP (Philippines), and BI (Indonesia) on Thursday
- The upcoming $50-200 billion AI IPO wave including OpenAI, xAI, and SpaceX may force capital rotation dynamics

**AI Disruption Accelerating**

The "SaaS apocalypse" continues spreading from software into logistics, wealth management, and media sectors. Supply glut of AI-generated software threatens structural margins despite near-term adoption barriers remaining significant.

**Outlook**

Key catalysts include the Trump-Xi summit in early April, requiring concrete deliverables to formalize any trade truce. The Rubio meeting in Munich suggests groundwork is underway, though Taiwan tensions complicate negotiations.

Korea equities appear well-positioned given AI hardware bottlenecks, accelerating earnings, reasonable valuations, and uncrowded positioning. The sector benefits from both cyclical recovery and AI capital expenditure trends.

China's platform sector faces structural headwinds from regulatory pressure, margin compression, and weak consumption, with earnings downgrades accelerating into March results season.
