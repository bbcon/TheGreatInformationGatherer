DAILY BRIEF:
Asian equities reached record highs despite US jobs data pushing Fed rate cut expectations to July from June. Dollar weakness persisted for a fifth consecutive session, defying stronger labor market data as offshore yuan approached the 6.90 handle. Indonesia's 70% nickel production cut supported battery material stocks amid broader AI infrastructure momentum.

**Labor Markets & Fed Policy**

US payrolls delivered 130,000 jobs, doubling median estimates and driving unemployment to 4.3%. The stronger-than-expected data repriced Fed rate cut expectations back approximately one month, with the first cut now anticipated in July rather than June.

- Treasury yields surged across the curve, with front-end moves most pronounced
- 2-year yields reached 3.5% as markets reduced dovish bets
- Market continues flip-flopping between conflicting signals: retail sales weakness versus jobs strength
- Despite payrolls beat, 2-3 rate cuts remain priced for 2026

**Asian Equity Outperformance**

MSCI Asia-Pacific posted its best year-to-date start this century, outperforming the S&P 500 by 10 percentage points. The region continues benefiting from cheaper valuations and AI supply chain exposure.

- Korea's Kospi hit fresh highs, with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix each gaining 3-4%
- Concentration risk extreme: these two stocks account for 51% of the index's gains
- Taiwan markets closed through next week for Lunar New Year
- MSCI Asia up 13% year-to-date versus S&P 500's 1% gain—widest 11-point gap since 2000

**Currency Dynamics**

The dollar's counterintuitive weakness despite strong jobs data suggests ongoing positioning unwinds. Offshore yuan strength accelerated, marking its longest winning streak in two years.

- USD declined for fourth-fifth consecutive session across majors
- Offshore yuan fixed at 6.9457, approaching the psychologically significant 6.90 level
- USD/JPY held near 152 handle, with intervention rhetoric persisting but coordinated action needed
- Underlying demand for AUD, CNY, and JPY continues despite US data strength

**Commodities & Supply Disruption**

Indonesia implemented dramatic nickel production cuts, reducing output quotas to 12 million tons from 42 million tons previously—a 70% reduction aimed at supporting prices.

- Shanghai and London nickel both gained 2.4% on supply restriction news
- Nickel miners rallied while downstream battery producers like CATL also moved higher
- Gold faced pressure from repriced Fed expectations despite broader dollar weakness
- Supply cuts create structural deficit risk for battery makers amid EV demand recovery

**Central Bank Policy Divergence**

Chinese monetary policy remained accommodative with the PBoC injecting approximately 450 billion yuan ahead of Lunar New Year, larger than the previous day's doubled amount.

- China 10-year yields fell for a fifth consecutive session to 1.80%, testing key support
- Japan's 40-year JGB yield dropped 10 basis points to 3.625%, a notable move in the super-long end
- RBA Governor opened door to further rate hikes if inflation remains sticky, diverging from global easing cycle

**Corporate Developments**

AI disruption narratives spread beyond traditional tech sectors, affecting wealth management, insurance, and property services. However, memory chip demand strengthened on agentic AI requirements.

- Luxottica shares surged 12% on 18% Q4 sales growth, selling over 7 million AI glasses in 2025
- Zhipu AI gained 9% pre-market on GLM-5 model launch competing with Anthropic
- NetEase fell 2% on weak gaming revenue miss

**Sector Rotation & Risks**

Structural headwinds emerged in traditional consumer sectors while AI infrastructure beneficiaries continued gaining.

- Japanese beer sales declined 11% in January, pressuring Budweiser APAC, Asahi, and Heineken
- Hyperscaler spending reached $650 billion annual run rate, up 60% year-over-year
- Alphabet's debt issuance signals funding diversification, though leverage remains low at 0.8x net debt/EBITDA

**Geopolitical Factors**

Trade policy uncertainty persisted with the Republican House defying Trump on Canada tariffs, though a presidential veto remains expected.

- USMCA withdrawal reportedly under private consideration, posing continent-wide trade risks
- China's military leadership shake-up continues with 5 of 7 Central Military Commission members removed or under investigation
- Political fractures growing ahead of US midterms, though policy changes remain limited
