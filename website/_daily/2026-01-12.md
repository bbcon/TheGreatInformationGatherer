Fed Chair Powell faced criminal investigation as DOJ served subpoenas over building renovation testimony, escalating an unprecedented assault on central bank independence that triggered broad dollar weakness and flight to safe havens.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Department of Justice launched a criminal probe into Powell's June testimony regarding Federal Reserve headquarters renovation costs, with Powell publicly accusing the Trump administration of "extortion" and "intimidation" as retaliation for maintaining data-dependent rate policy. This marks the first time a Fed chair has directly challenged a sitting president over central bank independence.

- Powell's term as chair expires May 2026, though he remains as governor until 2028
- Republican Senator Tom Tillis pledged to block any Fed nominations until the investigation resolves
- Markets removed January rate cut expectations following Friday's stronger-than-expected jobless claims data
- Kevin Hassett emerged as frontrunner for Fed chair, with political connections favored over Fed insiders

**Currency & Fixed Income**

The dollar collapsed across all G10 pairs as the Fed independence crisis sparked a "sell America" trade, with the Bloomberg Dollar Index trading at a 3% discount to model fair value.

- EUR/USD rose as dollar weakness accelerated
- USD/CNY fell to 6.97, marking the yuan's strongest level in months
- USD/JPY reversed from 158+ to 157 amid intervention risk concerns
- Treasury curve steepened with 30-year yields rising 5bps to 486bp and 2-year yields up 3bps to 352bp
- Markets pricing long-term inflation risk from potential Fed policy interference

**Equities & Earnings**

US equity futures declined as institutional flows rotated toward Asian markets, while regional performances diverged sharply.

- S&P 500 futures fell 0.6% with Nasdaq futures down 0.9%
- VIX elevated to 16.5, signaling measured de-risking ahead of key data releases
- Asian markets outperformed with Hang Seng Tech gaining 2% and Taiwan/Korea up 1%
- China's CSI 300 advanced 0.5% with A-shares favored over H-shares year-to-date
- Major bank earnings begin Tuesday with JPMorgan, followed by Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup Wednesday

**Commodities & Safe Havens**

Precious metals surged to fresh records on dual safe-haven demand from Fed uncertainty and geopolitical risk, while oil markets remained contained despite Iran instability.

- Gold hit record $4,600/oz (+2.3%), now viewed as strategic allocation beyond tactical positioning
- Silver jumped 5% to new highs, marking its fourth consecutive month of double-digit gains
- Brent crude held near $63/bbl despite Iran supply concerns, capped by Q1 refinery maintenance and Chinese inventory stockpiles
- Copper gained 3% as industrial metals strength continued

**Geopolitical Risk**

Iran faced existential regime pressure with over 500 protesters killed and 10,000+ imprisoned, while the government imposed internet blackouts and currency collapse accelerated popular unrest.

- Trump considering "strong military options" while remaining open to diplomatic engagement on nuclear issues
- Iran supplies 90% of its oil exports (~2M bpd) to China, representing 13-14% of Chinese imports
- Potential supply disruption manageable short-term given Chinese stockpiles but would force competition for Middle East grades
- Japan's PM Ishiba may call snap elections as early as January 23 with voting February 8-15

**Corporate Developments**

Trump's demand for 10% credit card rate caps pressured financial stocks despite lacking legislative backing, while tech partnerships drove selective strength.

- Capital One declined 10-12% with JPMorgan and Citigroup also falling on regulatory uncertainty
- Walmart gained 3.5% on Alphabet/Gemini AI shopping partnership announcement plus NASDAQ 100 inclusion effective January 20
- Meituan led Hong Kong tech gains (+3%) as China ended food delivery price wars, providing margin relief

**Key Catalysts Ahead**

Tuesday brings December CPI data, which may contain residual issues from the government shutdown, followed by Wednesday's PPI and retail sales releases. The Supreme Court may also rule Wednesday on AIPA tariff legality, though the administration likely possesses alternative legal authorities for implementation.
