Venezuela's regime change drove metals higher and energy volatility, while equity markets extended gains on broadening participation beyond mega-cap technology. The S&P 500 reached fresh records for the third consecutive session as small caps outperformed and rotation from AI-centric names accelerated.

**Venezuela & Geopolitics**

Venezuela saw Delcy Rodriguez sworn in as acting president following Maduro's reported arrest, though regime structures remain largely unchanged. Markets showed measured responses given limited near-term implications:

- Venezuelan bonds rallied 10 cents to 40-cent range but remain deeply distressed
- Oil production timeline remains 10+ years to meaningful restoration, requiring $100+ billion investment
- Current production at ~1 million bpd versus 3+ million bpd peak in 1998
- China ordered banks to assess Venezuelan exposure on $160+ billion total debt outstanding
- WTI crude fell 2.4% after initial Venezuela-driven gains, reflecting oversupply concerns

Trump's Greenland acquisition threats intensified diplomatic tensions, with Denmark warning NATO would end if attacked by the US.

**Equities & Market Rotation**

US markets extended their rally with notable broadening beyond technology leadership:

- S&P 500 gained 0.6% to fresh records, materials sector led performance
- Russell 2000 outperformed for third straight session, up 1.4%
- Regional banks preferred over money centers given valuation gaps: regionals trade 9-11x earnings versus JPMorgan at 15x, Wells Fargo at 14x
- Small and mid-caps up 1.4% and 1.5% respectively, signaling quality rotation over speculation

**Technology Divergence**

AI skepticism mounted despite bullish commentary, with notable sector divergence:

- Apple declined for fifth consecutive session, AMD fell despite CEO claiming compute needs must grow 100x
- Memory/storage stocks surged on Nvidia CEO comments: SanDisk +27%, Western Digital +17%, Micron +10%
- Data center cooling stocks crushed: Johnson Controls -11%, Modine -21% after Nvidia revealed Rubin chips can cool with 45°C water, eliminating chiller requirements
- Nvidia peaked in November while S&P 500 hit three consecutive records since, marking first sustained market decoupling in years

**Asian Markets**

Chinese onshore markets hit multi-year highs with strongest start since 2015:

- CSI 300 gained 2% to 4-year high at 4,747, Shanghai Composite nearing decade highs
- Tech/chips led with 2.3% gains, driven by policy support and liquidity flows
- A-shares outperformed H-shares as onshore volumes reached 3-month highs
- CNY strengthened to 6.98 handle despite weak fundamentals, PBOC showing mild pushback

**Commodities**

Base metals rally accelerated on tariff frontloading and supply concerns:

- Copper reached record $13,000/ton on LME, up 20% since late November
- Nickel surged 10% in largest spike in over two years
- Silver hit record highs for third consecutive session
- US tariff threats driving import rush ahead of potential mid-2026 implementation

**Central Banks & Rates**

Federal Reserve messaging suggested extended pause as economic resilience reduces urgency for cuts:

- Markets price two cuts for 2026, weighted toward first half
- Fed's Dudley expects central bank on hold for "much of 2026" given moderating inflation and strengthening economy
- 10-year yield at 4.165%, highest versus 2-year in nine months
- Shelter disinflation accelerating with real-time data (Zillow, Apartment List) showing flat prices versus BLS +4%

**Key Risks**

Multiple crosscurrents warrant monitoring:

- Venezuela stability uncertain with regime structure unchanged, risk of civil unrest and regional backlash
- AI bubble concerns intensifying as investors rotate away despite bullish CEO commentary
- Data center power constraints remain limiting factor for AI buildout despite cooling technology advances
- Balance sheet policy debate looming as incoming Fed leadership wants smaller portfolio while maintaining ample reserves

The session reinforced themes of market broadening and rotation away from concentrated technology positions, while geopolitical developments in Venezuela provided limited lasting market impact given long-term production restoration timelines. Focus shifts to ISM Services Wednesday and employment data Friday for cleaner economic reads post-government shutdown.
