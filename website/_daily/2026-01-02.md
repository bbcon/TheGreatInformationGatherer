Wall Street begins 2026 with unprecedented bullish consensus as all 21 surveyed strategists expect S&P 500 gains, marking the narrowest forecast range since 2017. Markets opened higher with NASDAQ futures gaining 1% while metals continued their multi-year rally.

**Equities & Positioning**

Technology stocks led the New Year's advance, extending 2025's concentrated leadership pattern with minimal sector broadening. 

- NASDAQ futures rose 1% on the first trading day, driven by familiar names including Micron, Palantir, and Nvidia
- Magnificent Seven stocks posted 25% gains in 2025, with analysts forecasting another 20-25% advance in 2026 as AI monetization enters a "prove it" phase
- S&P 500 strategist targets average 10% upside for 2026, following three consecutive years of double-digit gains—the longest such streak since the late 1990s
- Zero bearish forecasts among Wall Street strategists represent the most uniform optimism in nearly a decade

**Monetary Policy & Rates**

The Federal Reserve's aggressive easing campaign faces persistent inflation pressures as markets price additional cuts despite elevated price data.

- Fed has delivered 175 basis points of cuts since September 2024, yet 10-year Treasury yields rose to 4.20%
- Market expectations center on 2-3 additional cuts in 2026 despite inflation remaining at 3%, well above the Fed's 2% target
- Treasury curve steepening accelerated in late 2025, with 30-year yields rising 6 basis points while 2-year yields fell 70 basis points
- NY Fed models show term premium expansion of 70 basis points, suggesting policy transmission mechanisms may be impaired

**Currency & Commodities**

The dollar's decline accelerated into year-end while industrial metals surged on supply constraints and demand expectations.

- Dollar posted worst annual performance since 2017 with a 9% decline, with strategists forecasting another 9% drop in 2026 driven by Fed easing
- Silver surged 148% in 2025, marking its best performance since 1979, while gold posted similar gains
- Aluminum crossed $3,000 per ton for the first time in over three years, supported by construction and renewable energy demand
- Emerging market currencies, particularly in Asia-Pacific, are expected to strengthen further against the dollar

**Fixed Income**

Bond markets delivered their strongest returns since 2020 despite Federal Reserve policy challenges and inflation persistence.

- Aggregate bond index returned 7.3% in 2025, the best performance since 2020
- Credit spreads compressed to post-crisis lows in high-yield markets, driven by absolute yield demand despite fundamental concerns
- 2026 bond return forecasts center on mid-single-digit gains, constrained by inflation risks and elevated term premiums
- Supply-demand imbalances pose widening risks for corporate credit spreads

**Corporate Developments**

Electric vehicle market dynamics shifted as Tesla faces delivery pressures while Chinese competition intensifies.

- Tesla deliveries expected to decline 11-15% year-over-year, reflecting increased competitive pressures
- BYD likely surpassed Tesla as the global electric vehicle leader based on preliminary delivery data
- AI monetization remains under scrutiny as investors demand concrete revenue conversion from infrastructure investments

**Geopolitical & Risk Factors**

Multiple flashpoints pose potential market disruption risks as the new administration prepares policy shifts.

- Venezuela regime change odds exceed 50% as opposition pressure mounts against Maduro
- Iran protest movements face "locked and loaded" threats from incoming Trump administration
- China-Taiwan military exercises continue while Latin America emerges as US-China proxy battleground
- Tariff implementation timeline remains uncertain but poses upside inflation risks

**Economic Data Outlook**

Holiday-distorted data complicates near-term economic assessment ahead of critical employment reports.

- December payrolls data (due January 9) represents first clean post-shutdown labor market reading
- Inflation persistence at 3% challenges Fed easing assumptions embedded in current market pricing
- Fiscal stimulus expectations add to inflationary pressures alongside tight labor market conditions

The combination of universal strategist optimism, compressed risk premiums, and unresolved policy uncertainties suggests potential vulnerability to even minor disappointments. While technology leadership and Fed easing support near-term momentum, the narrow consensus and elevated valuations warrant cautious positioning ahead of AI monetization tests and inflation data that could challenge current assumptions.
