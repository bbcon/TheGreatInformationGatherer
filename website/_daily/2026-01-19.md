Chinese economic data revealed severe structural weakness despite meeting growth targets, while Trump's Greenland tariff threats triggered risk-off flows into precious metals and away from European assets.

**China Economic Data**

China delivered mixed Q4 results that met headline growth targets but exposed deepening domestic weakness beneath export-driven strength.

- GDP growth of 4.5% in Q4 brought full-year 2025 to exactly 5.0%, meeting Beijing's target
- Fixed asset investment turned negative for the first time in history at -3.8% year-to-date, signaling collapsing domestic confidence since data series began in 1998
- Retail sales growth of 0.9% in December missed consensus of 1.0%, marking the seventh consecutive month of deceleration
- Industrial production beat expectations at 5.2% versus 5.0% consensus, driven by export activity
- New home prices declined 0.37% month-over-month, a modest improvement from November's -0.39% but still contracting for the 18th consecutive month
- Youth unemployment rose to 16.9% in November, reflecting structural labor market pressures from automation

The data illustrates China's growing reliance on external demand as domestic consumption and investment deteriorate, with households holding approximately ¥7 trillion in maturing deposits but retail sales growth remaining unsustainably weak.

**Geopolitical Tensions**

Trump escalated pressure on European allies over Greenland, threatening tariff implementation that would exceed existing China tariff levels.

- 10% tariffs threatened for February 1, rising to 25% by June 1 on EU allies including Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, and UK
- European Union considering €93 billion in retaliatory tariffs plus deployment of anti-coercion instruments restricting US technology market access
- Trump's scheduled Davos speech Wednesday represents critical inflection point for diplomatic resolution

**Precious Metals & Safe Havens**

Geopolitical uncertainty drove significant flows into real assets and traditional safe havens.

- Gold gained 2% to fresh record highs on flight-to-safety demand
- Silver surged 6% as investors sought precious metals diversification
- Swiss franc outperformed other major currencies
- Japanese yen strengthened below 158 level against the dollar

**Asian Equities**

Chinese markets showed mixed performance with A-shares demonstrating relative resilience compared to offshore H-shares.

- Hang Seng declined 1.1% while CSI 300 fell a more modest 0.3%
- Alibaba dropped 2.7% and Meituan fell 1%, reflecting continued pressure on major technology names
- BYD gained 1% on Canada EV quota benefits
- Cambrian semiconductor advanced 95% year-to-date on GPU localization themes, trading at 100x price-to-earnings

**European Markets**

European futures declined on tariff concerns while defense-related equities gained on rearmament themes.

- Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell 1.3% on transatlantic trade tensions
- Defense stocks rallied regionally as European rearmament narrative gained momentum
- Industrial metals including copper and iron ore declined 2.6% following Friday's China data reaction

**Central Bank Developments**

Federal Reserve Chair succession uncertainty continued with potential candidates emerging as Trump considers keeping Kevin Hassett in the White House rather than nominating him for Fed leadership.

- Race now appears between Kevin Warsh, former Fed Governor, and Rick Rieder from BlackRock
- Markets assume any Trump appointee will favor easier monetary policy despite weak economic case for rate cuts
- People's Bank of China implemented selective 10 basis point rate cuts targeting specific sectors rather than broad-based stimulus
- Bank of Japan meeting scheduled for Friday with consensus expecting no rate hike but focus on maintaining policy optionality

**Fixed Income**

Japanese government bond yields continued their ascent ahead of this week's BOJ meeting.

- 30-year JGB yields rose 10 basis points as markets position for potential policy shifts
- Consensus expects no immediate rate hike but attention on BOJ communication regarding future policy direction

**Currency Markets**

The Chinese yuan held relatively stable despite dollar weakness as authorities managed exchange rate stability.

- CNY fixing at 7.0051 remained above the psychologically important 7.00 level
- PBoC appears focused on managing stability rather than allowing significant appreciation despite underlying dollar softness
