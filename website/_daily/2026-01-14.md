**Inflation & Economic Data**

December CPI data showed mixed signals on the inflation trajectory. Core CPI rose 0.2% month-over-month, slightly below expectations, bringing the year-over-year rate to 2.6% - matching a four-year low. However, the median CPI measure suggested underlying inflation remains closer to 3% annualized, with super core services (excluding shelter) running at 3.5% annualized.

Producer Price Index data is due at 8:30 ET today, along with retail sales figures that will provide insight into consumer spending momentum heading into year-end. November retail sales are expected to show 0.5% monthly growth.

China reported a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus for 2025, though the U.S. share of Chinese exports fell to a historic low of 11% as tariffs redirected trade flows toward Europe and Latin America. December export growth of 6.6% more than doubled consensus expectations of 3.1%, with no visible payback from earlier front-loading activity.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Department of Justice probe into Fed Chair Powell escalated, with Trump promising to name a replacement "within weeks" while calling Powell "lousy" and "too late" on rate cuts. The investigation centers on building renovation cost overruns, prompting an unprecedented coordinated defense from three former Fed chairs and global central bank governors from the ECB, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of Australia, and others.

Despite the political pressure, markets showed little reaction in bonds - the 10-year Treasury yield held near 4.15% and rate cut expectations remain pushed out to mid-2026. Swap markets are pricing no Fed cuts until June at the earliest, with 75 basis points of cuts already delivered in the second half of 2025.

**Equities & Earnings**

JP Morgan shares fell 4% despite beating earnings estimates, dragged down by a sharp miss in investment banking fees which declined 2% versus expectations for 19% growth. The disappointment raised concerns about fee timing issues and set a cautious tone ahead of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup results later this week.

The broader banking sector dropped 1.9% as Trump's proposed 10% credit card interest rate cap threatens significant revenue cuts. Payment processors Visa and Mastercard also declined on the regulatory overhang.

Energy led sector performance with a 1.5% gain as oil prices hit two-month highs on escalating Iran tensions. The S&P 500 closed down 0.2% while the Nasdaq fell 0.1% after fading an early rally.

**Commodities**

Precious metals exploded higher on a combination of debasement fears, geopolitical tensions, and Fed independence concerns. Silver surged past $90 per ounce to record highs, while gold topped $4,600. Industrial metals also rallied, with copper and tin hitting all-time highs on expectations for Fed rate cuts and supply constraints.

The metals rally reflected what traders termed a "commodity security theme" as U.S.-China decoupling drives demand for critical materials. Central bank gold purchases have increased foreign reserve allocations from 6% to 22% since 2020, providing structural support.

**China Markets**

Chinese equities extended their rally to two-month highs with record turnover of 3.6 trillion RMB on Tuesday and over 1 trillion RMB in the first 30 minutes of Wednesday trading. The Hang Seng reached 27,000 with technology stocks leading gains, while the CSI 300 IT index rose 3%.

However, authorities moved to cool speculation by raising margin financing requirements to 100% from 80%, causing some reversal in A-shares. The stronger renminbi below 7.0 versus the dollar has been a key driver of equity inflows according to strategists.

**Geopolitics**

Trump intensified rhetoric on Iran, urging protesters to "take over institutions" while warning of potential military strikes on non-military infrastructure. The administration is also considering 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran. Over 2,500 protesters have reportedly been killed, with the first execution potentially imminent.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on Trump's reciprocal tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating 60% odds that Trump loses. The decision could affect $133 billion in tariff revenue, though alternative authorities like Section 232 remain available.

**Currency & International**

The Japanese yen weakened sharply past 159 versus the dollar on speculation about a snap election, with USD/JPY posting its worst day since late 2024. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.6% to new records while Japanese government bonds extended their losing streak to eight consecutive sessions.

**Key Catalysts Ahead**

- Supreme Court tariff ruling potentially today at 10 AM ET
- PPI and retail sales data at 8:30 ET
- Bank earnings continue with BAC, WFC, and Citi later this week
- Fed meeting January 28 with no rate action expected
- Potential Iran military intervention decision
- Powell replacement announcement expected within weeks

The combination of political pressure on the Fed, geopolitical tensions, and mixed economic signals has created a complex backdrop for markets, with safe-haven assets and commodities benefiting while traditional risk assets remain rangebound despite strong underlying fundamentals.
