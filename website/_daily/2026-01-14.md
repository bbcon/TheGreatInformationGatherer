US metals hit historic highs with gold above $4,600 and silver topping $90 as Fed independence concerns and geopolitical tensions drive safe-haven demand, while mixed bank earnings signal potential headwinds ahead of key data releases.

**Economic Data & Fed Policy**

December inflation data came in softer than expected, with CPI at 2.7% versus consensus, supporting the case for Fed rate cuts despite political pressure from the incoming administration. However, the softer print failed to shift market expectations for a March rate cut.

- PPI data due at 8:30 ET today alongside retail sales figures
- Jobless claims fell unexpectedly, suggesting continued labor market strength
- Fed independence debate escalates as DOJ investigation continues, with Trump calling Powell "lousy" and "too late" on cuts
- Rare joint statement from ECB, BoE, RBA, RBNZ, SNB, Riksbank, and BoC defending Fed independence
- Jamie Dimon warns Fed pressure could backfire, leading to higher inflation and rates

**Precious Metals Rally**

Gold and silver hit fresh all-time highs as investors pile into precious metals amid mounting uncertainty over Fed independence and geopolitical risks.

- Gold traded above $4,600, up 7% year-to-date
- Silver surged past $90, gaining 5% year-to-date with reports of physical scarcity in London
- Industrial metals also hit records, with copper, tin, and aluminum reaching new highs
- Inverted options skew in gold suggests further upside potential
- Central bank gold buying continues, with reserves allocation rising from 6% to 22% since 2020

**Banking Sector Earnings**

Mixed results from major banks despite strong underlying fundamentals, with investment banking fees showing particular weakness.

- JPM fell 5% over three sessions after debt underwriting revenues missed by 21 percentage points (down 2% versus +19% expected)
- Bank of America gained 1.7% on record net interest income of $15.75B and strong investment banking
- Wells Fargo declined 2.5% on NII miss and higher severance costs
- Citi rose 1.8% with dealmaking fees up 84%
- Credit card rate cap proposal at 10% creates regulatory overhang for sector

**China Trade & Markets**

China delivered stronger-than-expected trade data while equity markets extended their rally to two-month highs.

- December exports rose 6.6% versus 3.1% consensus, with no evidence of front-loading reversal
- Full-year trade surplus reached record $1.2 trillion
- US share of Chinese exports fell to historic low of 11% as trade redirected to EU and Latin America
- Hang Seng reached 27,000, with record turnover of 3.6 trillion RMB on Tuesday
- CSI 300 IT sector gained 3% as tech and hardware led the rally
- RMB strength below 7.0 versus the dollar cited as key driver of equity inflows

**Geopolitical Risks**

Multiple geopolitical flashpoints continue to support risk-off positioning in precious metals and other safe havens.

- Iran protests death toll exceeds 2,500 with first execution potentially imminent
- Trump encouraging protesters to "take over institutions" and warning help is "on the way"
- Supreme Court tariff ruling expected today on IEEPA reciprocal tariffs affecting $133B in revenue
- 25% tariffs threatened on nations doing business with Iran

**Market Positioning**

Equities showed mixed performance with some rotation away from mega-cap tech toward smaller names and commodities.

- S&P 500 declined 0.4% with Nasdaq down 0.6% for first back-to-back losses in 2026
- Russell 2000 outperformed for eighth straight session before futures reversed
- SOX index hit new records while software lagged the broader rally
- Bitcoin reached $95,000, wiping out $600M in bearish bets
- 10-year Treasury yields held steady at 4.15% despite Fed drama
- Oil steadied after four-day rally, its biggest gain in over six months

**Key Risks Ahead**

The combination of political pressure on the Fed, potential Supreme Court tariff ruling, and escalating Iran tensions creates multiple catalysts for market volatility despite currently subdued bond volatility at historic lows.
