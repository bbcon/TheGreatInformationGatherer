DAILY BRIEF:
US retail sales stalled in December while Chinese inflation missed expectations, reinforcing dovish central bank expectations globally. Software and wealth management sectors extended declines on AI disruption fears, though defensive sectors outperformed amid the rotation away from technology. Markets positioned cautiously ahead of January payrolls data expected to show significant weakness.

**Economic Data & Fed Policy**

December retail sales data disappointed across the board, with headline growth flat at 0% versus expectations for modest expansion. The underlying details proved even weaker:

- 8 of 13 retail categories declined month-over-month
- Control group fell 0.1%, signaling softer underlying consumer demand
- Data supports the Fed's dovish pivot as consumer spending momentum fades

Markets have repriced Fed expectations aggressively, now pricing three rate cuts by year-end versus two previously. The shift follows retail sales weakness and anticipation of a poor January jobs report:

- Payrolls consensus at 65K with whispers as low as 36-40K
- Expected massive downward revisions to 2025 data due to birth-death model changes
- Bloomberg Economics forecasts potential revision of monthly average from +49K to zero

**China Disinflation Persists**

Chinese inflation data undershot expectations, highlighting persistent deflationary pressures despite policy stimulus:

- CPI rose just 0.2% year-over-year versus 0.4% expected
- PPI deflation continued for the 40th consecutive month at -1.4%
- Morgan Stanley notes PPI improvement reflects global commodity prices, not domestic demand recovery
- China 10-year yields approached record lows near 1.8%

The PBOC pushed back against yuan strength with the daily fix at 6.9438 versus 6.9109 expected, signaling discomfort with excessive appreciation that could worsen deflationary pressures.

**Equity Markets & Sector Rotation**

Major indices finished mixed as defensive sectors outperformed technology:

- S&P 500 declined 0.3% while Dow reached record highs with a 0.1% gain
- Russell 2000 has surged 21% over six months versus 10% for large caps
- Small cap earnings revisions show +17% forward EPS growth versus +9% for S&P 500

Sector performance reflected ongoing rotation away from growth toward defensive names:

- Utilities (+1.6%), REITs (+1.4%), and Materials (+1.3%) led gains
- Technology and Communications lagged amid continued AI disruption concerns

**AI Disruption Spreads Beyond Software**

Wealth management and professional services firms extended declines as AI tools threaten traditional business models:

- Charles Schwab fell 7.4% and Raymond James declined 8.8% on Altruist's AI tax planning tool launch
- Software names showed mixed performance with DataDog surging 14% despite weak guidance
- The selloff follows similar patterns in insurance brokerage and enterprise software

Goldman Sachs CEO called the software selloff "overdone," suggesting potential buying opportunities for quality names at depressed valuations.

**Fixed Income & Currency Markets**

Treasury yields fell sharply on weak economic data and dovish Fed repricing:

- 10-year yields dropped 6 basis points to 4.14% as investors positioned for disappointing payrolls
- Front-end rates pricing in multiple Fed cuts through 2026
- Curve remains relatively flat around 133 basis points (2s30s)

Dollar weakness accelerated across major pairs:

- USD/JPY fell 1.0% to 154.32, benefiting cyclical companies with overseas exposure
- Euro strength may pressure ECB policy if appreciation continues
- Asian equities hit record highs on the inverse correlation with dollar weakness

**Commodities & Bitcoin**

Gold extended gains above $5,000 per ounce on Fed repricing and safe-haven demand. Oil prices remained stable around $64 WTI and $69 Brent despite ongoing Iran-Israel tensions.

Bitcoin pulled back 2% to $68,750 after failing to sustain above $70,000, with institutional flows remaining mixed despite whale accumulation.

**Key Risks & Catalysts**

Friday's January payrolls report represents the primary near-term catalyst, with potential for significant market volatility if data confirms weakness. The risk of regime shift from "bad news is good" to genuine growth concerns looms if economic data deterioration accelerates.

Medicare Advantage rate pressure emerged as CMS held 2027 rates flat against high single-digit cost trends, pressuring CVS and peer margins despite mitigation efforts.

Geopolitical tensions persist with divergent views between Trump and Netanyahu on Iran deal scope, raising military action risks if negotiations stall.
