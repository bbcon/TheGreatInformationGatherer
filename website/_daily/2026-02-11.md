US retail sales stalled in December while Chinese inflation missed expectations, reinforcing dovish central bank narratives globally. Markets continued rotating from growth to defensive sectors amid persistent AI disruption concerns across professional services. Tomorrow's January payrolls report could catalyze further Fed easing expectations with consensus at 65k but whisper numbers near 40k.

**Economic Data & Fed Policy**

December retail sales disappointed with 0% growth versus expectations for a modest increase, marking broad-based consumer weakness into year-end.

- Eight of 13 retail categories declined month-over-month
- Retail sales control group fell 0.1%, signaling softer underlying demand
- 10-year Treasury yields dropped 6bp to 4.14% on the weak data
- Markets now pricing closer to three Fed rate cuts than two for 2026

Tomorrow's January payrolls report represents a critical inflection point for Fed policy expectations.

- Consensus estimate: 65k jobs added (whisper number: 40k)
- Expected benchmark revisions could strip 30-50k jobs per month from 2024 data
- Break-even employment now estimated at 30-35k (down from historical 100k) due to shrinking labor force
- Cleveland Fed's Hammack and other new FOMC voters pushing back on aggressive easing expectations

**China Deflation Concerns**

Chinese inflation data reinforced persistent deflationary pressures despite recent policy stimulus efforts.

- January CPI rose just 0.2% year-over-year versus 0.4% expected (prior: 0.8%)
- PPI deflation eased to -1.4% from -1.5%, marking the 40th consecutive month of contraction
- Morgan Stanley noted PPI improvement reflects global commodity prices, not domestic demand recovery
- China 10-year government bond yields approaching record lows near 1.8%
- PBOC yuan fixing at 6.9438 versus 6.9109 estimate, pushing back against excessive currency strength

**Equity Market Rotation**

Defensive sectors continued outperforming as growth concerns mounted and AI disruption fears spread beyond technology.

- S&P 500 declined 0.3%, Nasdaq fell 0.6%, while Dow reached record highs (+0.1%)
- Utilities (+1.6%), REITs (+1.4%), and Materials (+1.3%) led gains
- Russell 2000 small caps up 21% over past six months versus S&P 500's 10% gain
- Small cap forward earnings revisions at +17% compared to +9% for large caps

AI disruption concerns expanded into new sectors, hammering professional services stocks.

- Wealth management firms plunged: Charles Schwab -7.4%, Raymond James -8.8%
- Altruist's AI tax planning tool launch triggered the selloff
- European software giant Dassault Systems suffered worst day since 1996 IPO on AI vulnerability concerns
- DataDog bucked the trend with +14% gain despite weak guidance, suggesting selective buying interest

**Asian Markets & FX**

Asian equities hit record highs on dovish Fed repricing while regional currencies strengthened against the dollar.

- MSCI China added 37 names (net +21) in quarterly rebalancing, heavily weighted toward AI/automation stocks
- Hang Seng Tech gained 0.6% with Alibaba rallying on RenBrain AI robotics model release
- SMIC fell over 7% on Q4 earnings miss and flat Q1 guidance
- Korea KOSPI rose 1% as retail investors rotated from US tech into domestic blue chips
- USD/JPY declined 1.0% to 154.32 as dollar weakness persisted

**Commodities & Crypto**

Gold extended gains above $2,900 per ounce on Fed easing expectations and geopolitical tensions.

- Fresh record highs driven by dovish Fed repricing and Middle East risks
- Bitcoin pulled back 2% to $68,750 after testing $70,000 resistance
- Whale wallets (>1,000 coins) continue accumulating despite institutional flow uncertainty

**Corporate Developments**

Earnings season revealed mixed results with notable divergences across sectors.

- Spotify surged 15% on record 38 million new Q4 user additions
- Medicare Advantage providers face pressure as CMS holds 2027 rates flat versus rising costs
- Commerce Bank raised NII guidance to €8.5 billion despite zero German GDP growth, citing international lending

**Key Risks Ahead**

Tomorrow's payrolls data could determine whether markets maintain the "bad news is good news" narrative or shift toward genuine growth concerns. Expected downward revisions to 2024 job creation may reveal labor market weakness more severe than previously understood. AI disruption shows signs of cascading across new industries weekly, creating both opportunities and risks for sector rotation strategies.
