The S&P 500 touched 7,000 for the first time as the Fed held rates steady in a 10-2 vote, but tech earnings revealed a stark divergence between companies successfully monetizing AI investments and those struggling to justify massive capital expenditures.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve maintained rates at 5.25-5.50% with two dissents from Waller and Mester calling for cuts. Powell emphasized the economy remains on "firm footing" with unemployment stabilized and inflation at 2.75%.

- No rate cuts expected through Powell's term ending in June
- Market pricing shows 14% probability of cuts in March/April, jumping to 50% by June
- Powell's final meeting scheduled for April 29th before new chair takes over May 23rd
- Trump indicated Fed chair announcement coming "next week"

**Equities & Earnings**

Tech earnings exposed a critical fault line in AI spending, with markets now differentiating between companies showing revenue returns versus those burning capital without clear monetization paths.

- **Meta +8-10%** on Q1 revenue guidance that crushed estimates despite announcing $135B capex (87% increase from $115B prior)
- **Microsoft -6-10%** as Azure growth of 38% disappointed against 66% capex increase to $38B
- **Apple** initially gained on $144B revenue (+16%) beating estimates but faded as AI strategy remains unclear
- **Tesla** volatile after announcing $20B capex for 2026 (double estimates) while discontinuing Model S/X to focus on AI/robotics

Software stocks collapsed broadly on AI disruption fears:
- **SAP -13-14%** on cloud weakness and competitive threats from AI startups
- **ServiceNow -7-8%** amid sector-wide concerns about AI monetization

**Semiconductors & Memory**

Memory chip shortages intensified as HBM production cannibalizes conventional DRAM and NAND supply, creating unprecedented pricing power.

- **Samsung and SK Hynix** reported record earnings but stocks fell on profit-taking
- **DRAM prices +120% year-over-year, NAND +90%** as HBM4 production consumes 3x silicon wafers versus conventional chips
- **ASML** reported €13B order book against €7B revenue, signaling severe supply constraints
- **Seagate +20%** on storage demand surge
- Hyperscalers now locking annual contracts versus quarterly arrangements

**Commodities**

Real assets continued their historic rally amid debasement concerns and infrastructure demand.

- **Gold hit new record at $5,514** on geopolitical uncertainty and dollar weakness
- **Silver reached $120/oz** with extreme volatility but sustained buying interest
- **Copper at $13,942** - 16-year high driven by China speculative buying and data center demand
- Market faces 300K-800K ton shortage in 26M ton copper market with no near-term substitutes
- **Oil: Brent $69.73, WTI $65** up 2%+ on Iran nuclear threats and Kazakhstan supply concerns

**Currency & Fixed Income**

The dollar remained under pressure despite Treasury Secretary Bessent's "strong dollar" rhetoric, trading near four-year lows.

- **USD down 0.1%** against G10 currencies as debasement concerns persist
- **EUR/USD at 1.19** with European investors questioning need for dollar hedges
- **10-year Treasury at 4.25%** little changed post-Fed decision
- **USD/JPY rebounded to 154** from 152 lows after coordinated intervention signals

**Global Markets**

Indonesia entered correction territory in dramatic fashion while China showed signs of property policy shifts.

- **Indonesia JCI -15%** over two days, wiping ~$80B market cap on MSCI probation warnings over free float issues
- Potential $8B passive outflows if downgraded to frontier market status by May
- **China property developers** surged on reports that "three red lines" debt metrics may be removed
- **Philippines GDP** missed at 3% (Q4), hitting 3-4 year lows

**Risks & Catalysts**

- **Iran escalation**: Trump threatened military strikes with "speed and violence" if no nuclear deal reached
- **Memory supply crunch**: 2+ year lag before new fab capacity comes online, pressuring device makers on input costs
- **AI capex sustainability**: Markets now picking winners versus losers as returns become scrutinized
- **Government shutdown risk**: Midnight January 31st deadline on Homeland Security funding
- **Indonesia MSCI decision**: Critical test for emerging market stability if downgrade proceeds

The day highlighted a maturing AI investment cycle where blanket enthusiasm has given way to rigorous assessment of capital allocation efficiency and revenue generation capability.
