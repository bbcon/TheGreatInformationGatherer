The S&P 500 touched 7,000 for the first time as Meta surged 8% on AI spending plans that drove revenue growth, while Microsoft fell 7% despite record capex as Azure growth disappointed. The Fed held rates with two dissents, signaling no cuts through Powell's June term end.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve held rates at 5.25-5.50% in a 10-2 vote, with Waller and Mester dissenting for cuts. Powell emphasized the economy remains on "firm footing" with inflation at 2.75% and labor markets stabilized.

- No rate cuts expected through Powell's June term end
- Market pricing shows 14% probability of cuts in March/April, rising to 50% by June  
- Two dissents signal potential policy shift under new Fed chair
- Trump expected to announce new Fed chair "next week" with Warsh, Waller, or Rieder as leading candidates

**Equities & Earnings**

Technology earnings revealed stark divergence in AI spending tolerance, with single-stock volatility reaching historic levels as markets shift from broad AI rally to winner selection.

- **Meta**: +8% on $135B capex guidance (87% increase) justified by record Q1 revenue beat

- **SAP**: -13% on cloud weakness and competitive threats from AI startups
- **ServiceNow**: -8% as AI disruption fears hammer software sector broadly

**Semiconductors & Memory**

Memory chip supply constraints intensified as HBM production cannibalizes conventional DRAM/NAND capacity, driving historic pricing gains.

- **Samsung/SK Hynix**: Record earnings on HBM4 ramp, though stocks fell on profit-taking
- **DRAM prices**: +120% year-over-year, NAND +90% as hyperscalers lock annual contracts
- **ASML**: €13B order book vs €7B revenue signals equipment supply constraints
- **SanDisk/Western Digital**: Record margins (51% vs 42% estimate) on memory shortages
- New fab capacity won't pressure pricing for 2+ years

**Commodities**

Debasement trade accelerated across precious metals and base metals, with copper hitting 16-year highs on supply deficits.

- **Gold**: Hit $5,514 record on geopolitical uncertainty and dollar debasement concerns

- **USD/JPY**: 154 after coordinated "rate check" intervention at 159-160 level

**Geopolitical & Risk Factors**

Iran tensions escalated as Trump threatened military strikes while Indonesia entered technical correction on MSCI downgrade risks.

**Outlook**

Markets face sustainability questions around AI capex as returns diverge sharply between hardware beneficiaries and software companies struggling to monetize spending. Memory chip shortages create structural pricing power lasting through 2027, while geopolitical risks support safe-haven demand for real assets amid ongoing dollar debasement concerns.
