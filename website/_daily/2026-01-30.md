**Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair nomination triggered modest market repricing Thursday, with precious metals experiencing historic declines as debasement trades unwound, while hot PPI data reinforced the case for fewer rate cuts in 2025.**

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as next Federal Reserve Chair, ending speculation about more dovish alternatives. Markets reacted with measured repositioning rather than dramatic moves.

- Treasury curve steepened modestly: 2-year yields -1bp to 3.54%, 10-year +2bp to 4.25%, 30-year +3bp to 4.90%
- Dollar strengthened +0.75% on the nomination news
- Rate cut expectations pushed further into 2025, with first move now priced for September
- Confirmation faces delays as Senator Tillis blocks all Fed nominees until DOJ probe of Powell concludes

Warsh's background as Fed Governor (2006-2011) emphasized hawkish credentials, particularly opposition to quantitative easing and preference for smaller balance sheets. However, his recent pivot toward supporting rate cuts based on AI productivity gains created uncertainty about his governing approach.

**Inflation Data**

December PPI came in significantly hotter than expected, reinforcing concerns about sticky wholesale price pressures.

- PPI rose 0.5% month-over-month versus 0.2% consensus
- Year-over-year PPI accelerated to 3.0% from 2.8% expected
- Core PPI jumped 0.7% monthly, more than triple the 0.2% estimate
- Data suggests core PCE could reach 3.1%+, above Powell's 3.0% projection

The inflation surprise supports the view that fewer rate cuts are appropriate in 2025, particularly given continued economic strength with Q4 GDP running above 4%.

**Equities & Earnings**

Equity markets declined modestly on the Warsh news, with technology names mixed amid continued strong earnings results.

- S&P 500 -0.6%, Nasdaq -0.6%, Russell 2000 -0.9%
- Apple reported record $144 billion quarterly revenue with China sales recovering to $25 billion
- SanDisk guidance came in 400% above consensus, confirming severe memory supply shortages
- Microsoft faced pressure despite strong results as investors questioned AI capex returns

The muted equity reaction suggested markets view reduced Fed accommodation as less critical than previously thought, with earnings growth driving performance.

**Commodities**

Precious metals experienced historic collapses as speculative positioning unwound following the Warsh nomination.

- Gold fell 8%, marking its worst single-day decline since 1983
- Silver plunged 29%, the worst drop since 1950, falling from recent highs near $120 to $80
- Copper declined 6% from $14,000 levels as industrial metals gave back gains
- The moves reflected unwinding of debasement trades built on Fed independence concerns

**Dollar & International Markets**

The dollar rallied broadly on expectations for a more hawkish Fed approach under Warsh leadership.

- Bloomberg Dollar Index gained 0.5% to 11.83
- EUR/USD faced pressure with BNP Paribas targeting 1.22
- Asian markets showed resilience with Hang Seng approaching 28,000, its highest since 2021
- Indonesia markets recovered after exchange CEO resignation following two-day rout

**Corporate Developments**

Technology sector earnings continued to drive market narratives around AI investment returns and supply chain constraints.

- Apple warned of "significant" memory chip cost increases affecting Q2 2025 margins
- SpaceX reportedly exploring Tesla merger ahead of potential mid-2026 IPO
- Amazon-OpenAI discussing $50 billion investment expansion
- SanDisk's massive guidance beat confirmed tight memory supply conditions

**Risk Factors**

Several developments warrant monitoring as potential market catalysts:

- Iran military escalation with US carrier deployment and nuclear deal ultimatum
- Government shutdown likely despite tentative congressional deal
- Minnesota immigration crisis with federal funding cuts threatened
- MSCI Indonesia may trigger $13 billion outflows if free float requirements not met

The day's developments reflect markets adapting to a potentially less accommodative Federal Reserve while grappling with persistent inflation pressures. The dramatic precious metals selloff suggests speculative positioning built around Fed independence concerns may be overdone, though the underlying policy uncertainty remains elevated.
