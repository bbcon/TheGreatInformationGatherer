Markets repriced Fed policy expectations as President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as next Fed Chair, with the hawkish former governor's appointment triggering a sharp reversal in precious metals and modest curve steepening despite muted equity reaction.

**Fed Chair Nomination & Monetary Policy**

Trump officially nominated Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, ending speculation around the central bank leadership transition.

- Warsh served as Fed Governor 2006-2011, known for hawkish stance and opposition to excessive QE during his tenure
- Markets interpreted nomination as less dovish than feared, with curve steepening as traders price reduced QE probability but potential for measured rate cuts
- Confirmation faces delays: Senator Tillis blocking all Fed nominees until DOJ probe of Powell concludes, creating timeline uncertainty
- Current FOMC positioning shows 10 of 12 members voted to hold rates at last meeting, requiring Warsh to build consensus for policy changes
- Market pricing pushed first rate cut expectations to September 2025, with only 1-2 cuts priced for full year

**Economic Data & Inflation**

December PPI came in notably above consensus, raising concerns about inflation persistence ahead of PCE data.

- PPI rose 0.5% MoM vs 0.2% expected, with 3.0% YoY vs 2.8% expected  
- Core PPI jumped 0.7% MoM against 0.2% consensus
- Data suggests core PCE may push above 3.1%, exceeding Powell's 3.0% projection
- Labor market remains resilient with unemployment at 4.4% for second consecutive month
- Q4 GDP referenced at 4%+ levels, indicating continued economic strength

**Market Performance & Positioning**

Equity markets posted modest declines while precious metals experienced historic selloffs as debasement trades unwound.

- S&P 500 fell 0.6% on the day, finishing January up 1.3% despite three consecutive weekly losses
- Nasdaq declined 0.6%, Russell 2000 down 0.9% as small caps underperformed
- Treasury curve steepened: 2Y yields fell 3bp to 3.54%, 10Y rose 2bp to 4.25%, 30Y gained 3bp to 4.90%
- Dollar strengthened 0.75% on Warsh nomination, posting strongest daily move in volatile week
- Gold crashed 8%, marking worst decline since 1983 as speculative positioning reversed
- Silver plunged 29%, worst drop since 1950, giving back significant gains from recent rally ($30→$120→$80)

**Corporate Earnings & Tech Sector**

Mixed results across major technology names highlighted divergent AI investment returns and supply chain pressures.

- Apple reported record Q1 revenue of $144B with iPhone sales reaching $85B
- China sales rebounded strongly to $25B, first time exceeding this level in four years  
- Management warned of "significant" memory chip cost pressures affecting Q2 margins
- Microsoft faced historic selloff as second-largest single-day drop ever on AI investment ROI concerns
- Meta gained 18% for the month on AI-driven advertising momentum
- SanDisk volatile on AI memory demand, finishing up 7% after intraday swings

**International Markets & Risks**

Asian markets showed resilience despite regional volatility, while Indonesia faced structural challenges.

- Indonesia stock exchange CEO resigned following 8% intraday decline before recovering to -1% close
- MSCI Indonesia faces potential $13B outflows if FTSE follows with downgrade over free float requirements
- Hang Seng approached 28,000 for first time since 2021 on China property speculation
- Korea doubled year-to-date gains with Samsung/SK Hynix comprising 30%+ of index

**Commodities & Energy**

Industrial metals pulled back from historic highs while energy markets stabilized above key levels.

- Copper declined 6% from $14,000 peak, though maintaining elevated levels on supply constraints
- Brent crude held above $70 for first time in months
- LME faced technical delays amid volatile commodity trading conditions

**Outlook & Positioning**

The Warsh nomination reduces immediate Fed independence concerns while creating new policy uncertainty around the balance between inflation control and employment objectives. Markets appear positioned for a more conventional monetary policy approach with reduced QE reliance, though confirmation delays add near-term uncertainty to the timeline for leadership transition.
