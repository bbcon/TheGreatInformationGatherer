DAILY BRIEF:
UK inflation fell to 3.0% in January from 3.4% prior, the lowest reading since March 2024, as fuel, airfare and food costs declined. FOMC minutes due at 2pm ET may provide clarity on the Fed's rate path as officials increasingly signal AI productivity gains could justify a higher neutral rate. Meanwhile, markets continue navigating sector-specific AI disruption with software names down 20% year-to-date amid uncertainty over terminal valuations.

**UK Data & BOE Outlook**

January CPI declined to 3.0% year-over-year, below the 3.4% prior reading, driven lower by fuel, airfare and food price declines.

- Services inflation remained elevated at 4.3%, a key concern for BOE policymakers
- March rate cut probability not fully priced despite the headline improvement and 5-4 vote split at the last meeting
- April cut remains fully priced by markets

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

FOMC minutes release at 2pm ET will be scrutinized for rate path clarity as Fed officials increasingly suggest productivity gains from AI may support a higher neutral rate.

- Fed's Daly noted AI productivity gains are "undeniable" but duration remains uncertain
- Officials appear less dovish than previously expected given productivity narrative
- Markets watching for any hawkish tilt that could pressure duration trades

**European Central Bank**

Speculation emerged that ECB President Lagarde may exit before her October 2027 term ends to ease French-German negotiations on board appointments.

- Long-dated volatility premiums in oversold software names may offer opportunities if AI disruption fears prove overdone
