Global bond yields surged as Japan's fiscal crisis deepened and Trump's escalating tariff threats on Europe triggered broad risk-off sentiment, with the S&P 500 posting its worst day since October.

**Japanese Fiscal Crisis & Global Bond Selloff**

Japan's 30-year JGB yields spiked 27 basis points as PM Takahashi's proposal to pause the 8% food sales tax for two years would add ¥5 trillion to the nation's already-highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G10. The fiscal deterioration is forcing a structural repricing of term premiums globally.

- 40-year JGB yields hit 4.0% for the first time since their 2007 debut
- 20-year yields rose 20 basis points to levels not seen since 2000
- ¥800 billion JGB auction scheduled amid weakest demand in a decade
- Snap election called for February 8th, adding political uncertainty

The JGB crisis is spilling over into global fixed income markets, with US Treasuries failing to act as a safe haven. The 10-year Treasury yield approached 4.30% (highest since August-September 2024), breaking above the 4.10-4.20% range that had held in recent weeks. The 30-year yield reached 4.93%, up 10 basis points, as markets reprice structural term premium higher.

**Trump Tariff Escalation**

Trump threatened 10% tariffs on eight EU nations by February 1st and 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne, prompting European leaders to split on response strategy. The moves echo April's "Liberation Day" tariffs that triggered broader market volatility.

- Germany, with its export-dependent economy, urges caution on retaliation
- France pushes for stronger response using anti-coercion instruments  
- Emergency EU Council meeting scheduled for Thursday
- Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff authority expected imminently

**Equity Market Rout**

The S&P 500 fell 2% to 5,794, its worst day since October 2024, testing critical technical support at the 100-day moving average of 5,745. Volume ran 41% above the 30-day average, indicating institutional selling rather than panic liquidation.

- Technology sector (XLK) led declines with a 3% drop
- Consumer Discretionary and Financials each fell over 2%
- Russell 2000 outperformed with only a 1.2% decline, suggesting rotation rather than systemic risk-off
- Consumer Staples was the only positive sector at +0.1%

**Corporate Earnings & Guidance**

Netflix shares fell 3.5% after hours despite beating Q4 estimates, as 2026 revenue guidance of $50.7-51.7 billion missed Street expectations around $51 billion. The company announced plans to pause share buybacks to fund its Warner Bros cash deal.

- Operating margin guidance of 31.5% missed the 32.4% estimate
- Content spending to increase 10% in 2026
- Netflix carrying over $8 billion in debt for the Warner Bros acquisition

United Airlines gained 1.8% after hours on strong Q4 results, beating EPS estimates at $3.10 versus $2.92 expected. However, 2026 EPS guidance of $12-14 came in below consensus of $13.60.

**Currency & Safe Haven Flows**

The dollar weakened across all G10 currency pairs despite rising Treasury yields, signaling a potential "sell America" trade similar to April's episode. This unusual divergence between dollar weakness and higher yields suggests genuine concerns about US policy uncertainty.

- USD/JPY held near 158, approaching intervention risk levels around 160
- EUR/USD strengthened despite tariff threats as confidence in the euro persisted
- Gold reached fresh record highs above $2,700
- Silver surged to $93, up 32% year-to-date with implied volatility at 65-70%

**Central Bank Developments**

Fed Chair announcement expected "as soon as next week" according to Treasury Secretary Bessent, with the race narrowed to four candidates: Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Chris Waller, and Rick Rieder. Markets continue pricing two rate cuts for 2026 despite robust economic data.

The ECB confirmed Boris Vujcic of Croatia as next Vice President, marking the first Eastern European on the executive board.

**China Market Intervention**

Chinese authorities appear to be actively cooling overheated markets, with the national team selling an estimated $25 billion in ETFs over two days - a dramatic reversal from 2024's support operations.

- MSCI China fell 0.5% for the fourth consecutive session
- CSI 300 ETF saw record outflows as authorities intentionally temper the rally
- LPR rates held unchanged despite property market concerns

The combination of Japanese fiscal stress, escalating trade tensions, and broad equity weakness suggests markets are repricing multiple risk factors simultaneously, with particular vulnerability in high-duration assets and leveraged positions.
