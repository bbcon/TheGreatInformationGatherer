**Hershey diversifies beyond chocolate amid elevated cocoa costs and GLP-1 adoption concerns.** CEO Kirk Tanner outlined strategic shift into gummies and salty snacks through celebrity partnerships and acquisitions, targeting growth categories as traditional chocolate faces margin pressure.

**Corporate Strategy & Earnings**

Hershey announced a significant portfolio expansion beyond its chocolate core, positioning the move as both growth initiative and hedge against multiple headwinds. The company is leveraging celebrity partnerships, including a new Shaquille O'Neal collaboration for its "Shackalicious" gummies line, marking its first major celebrity IP deal.

- Expanding into non-chocolate categories: gummies and salty snacks through recent acquisitions including Dots Pretzels, Pirates Booty, and Lesser Evil
- Targeting completion of natural dye transition by end-2027 to meet consumer demand for less processed ingredients  
- Developing protein line (Fulfill) and portion control products as hedges against GLP-1 impact on snacking behavior
- CEO emphasizes confection category resilience despite weight-loss drug adoption, citing occasion-based consumption patterns

**Commodities & Cost Pressures**

Cocoa prices remain a key margin headwind despite recent stabilization, driving Hershey's strategic pivot toward less cocoa-dependent categories.

- Cocoa futures stabilizing but maintaining elevated levels near record highs
- Cost pressures from cocoa driving strategic diversification rather than just pricing actions
- Company positioning that stabilization does not equate to normalization of input costs
- Margin defense strategy relies heavily on category mix shift rather than commodity cost relief

**Consumer & Health Trends**

The strategic shift reflects broader changes in consumer behavior around health-conscious snacking and the potential impact of GLP-1 medications on food consumption patterns.

- GLP-1 adoption accelerating but CEO maintains confection category showing resilience
- Company hedging through expansion into "permissible" categories including protein and portion-controlled options
- Consumer demand for natural ingredients driving reformulation timeline and product development priorities
- Targeting new consumer segments through diversified portfolio approach rather than defending chocolate-only positioning

**Market Implications**

Hershey's pivot signals broader pressure on traditional confectionery companies to diversify amid multiple structural challenges. The move represents a more aggressive expansion strategy compared to previous incremental growth initiatives.

- M&A activity likely to continue as company builds non-chocolate capabilities through acquisitions
- Strategic shift reduces direct cocoa price sensitivity but requires execution across unfamiliar categories
- Celebrity partnership model could become template for other traditional food companies seeking growth
- Portfolio diversification positions company as multi-category snack player rather than chocolate specialist

The announcement highlights the intersection of commodity cost pressures, changing health trends, and evolving consumer preferences forcing traditional food companies to fundamentally reassess their business models. Hershey's aggressive diversification suggests management views current headwinds as structural rather than cyclical, warranting strategic rather than tactical responses.
