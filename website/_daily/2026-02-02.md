Precious metals experienced historic liquidation as gold fell 8-10% and silver crashed below $80, driven by Kevin Warsh's Fed chair nomination and forced unwinding of speculative positions, while China's unexpected PMI contraction to 49.3 added pressure across commodities.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed chair sparked the initial selloff in precious metals and broader risk assets. Markets interpreted the selection as hawkish on balance sheet policy but potentially dovish on rates.

- Former Atlanta Fed's Lockhart expects no cuts in H1 2025, possibly one cut in H2
- Warsh's focus on balance sheet reduction may allow lower rates without inflation risk
- Senate confirmation appears on track despite procedural delays from Tom Tillis blocking until DOJ investigation of Powell concludes
- Market reassessing rate path expectations ahead of upcoming ECB and BOE decisions Thursday

**Precious Metals Liquidation**

Historic volatility gripped precious metals markets as speculative positions unwound violently.

- Gold: fell 8-10% to $2,840-$4,494 range (sources vary), down from $3,200-$5,500 recent highs
- Silver: crashed 13-40% over recent sessions, briefly falling below $80 after Friday's record $40 intraday drop
- Gold 10-day volatility reached highest levels in decades; silver volatility highest in 45+ years
- CME raised margins twice, forcing additional liquidation
- Chinese retail investors heavily exposed; ETFs halted due to premiums, physical gold queues forming in Hong Kong
- Gold/silver ratio normalized to ~60 from sub-50 extreme levels

**China Economic Data**

China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly contracted, adding pressure to commodity-sensitive assets.

- Manufacturing PMI: 49.3 (missed all estimates, back into contraction territory)
- Non-manufacturing PMI: 49.4 (missed every forecast)
- Caixin PMI: 50.3 (private gauge slightly better, at top of estimates)
- BYD January sales: fell 30% YoY to 210,000 units as EV subsidy rollback hurts demand
- PBOC set dollar/CNY fix stronger than estimates at 6.95 - first time since November, potentially signaling tolerance limits for weakness

**Equities & Tech**

Asian markets declined broadly while tech faced pressure from AI investment uncertainty.

- Hang Seng -1%, CSI 300 materials -5%, Korea -3% (won weakest in Asia)
- NASDAQ futures -0.7% after Jensen Huang clarified Nvidia's OpenAI commitment is "not $100B"
- Oracle raising $50B (half via equity dilution) signals investor skepticism on AI returns
- OpenAI valued at $800B amid funding uncertainty
- Mining stocks extended losses: Zijin Mining -10%, China Silver Group -4%, copper names down 3-7%

**Commodities**

Broad-based commodity weakness extended beyond precious metals.

- Copper: Shanghai futures -7%, extending slump on China demand concerns
- Oil: Brent -3-5% to $65/bbl as geopolitical premium unwinds on US-Iran diplomatic progress
- Base metals declining: aluminum, tin, nickel all lower
- Commodity currencies underperforming as dollar extends Friday's gains

**Fixed Income & FX**

Bond markets remained relatively stable despite precious metals volatility.

- Treasuries showing modest haven bid after initial selloff on Warsh nomination
- 30Y at 4.85%, 10Y at 4.21%, 2Y at 3.52% as market reassesses Fed trajectory
- Dollar holding gains with DXY +0.2%, supported by hawkish Fed expectations
- EUR/USD reversing recent strength ahead of ECB meeting Thursday

**Geopolitical Developments**

US-Iran tensions showing signs of easing, contributing to oil price decline.

- Diplomatic talks progressing through Qatari/Egyptian mediation
- Framework reportedly agreed per Iran's Larijani, though Supreme Leader warns of "regional war" if US strikes
- Geopolitical risk premium rapidly unwinding from commodity prices

**Key Risks**

Several factors suggest continued market volatility ahead.

- Speculative unwind in precious metals may be incomplete, with Chinese retail capitulation ongoing
- Indonesia faces MSCI frontier market downgrade risk, accelerating passive outflows
- Lunar New Year period typically supports gold buying, but current sentiment uncertain
- AI valuation concerns spreading as mega-cap earnings approach (Alphabet/Amazon this week)

The combination of Fed policy uncertainty, China growth concerns, and forced liquidation in speculative positions created a risk-off environment that may persist until positioning normalizes and policy clarity emerges.
