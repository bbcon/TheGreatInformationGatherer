DAILY BRIEF:
The Supreme Court struck down Trump's reciprocal tariff system, forcing the administration to implement a 15% global baseline tariff under emergency powers for 150 days. Asian markets rallied on lower effective tariff rates while US assets weakened on policy uncertainty. Gold approached record levels near $5,158/oz as traders positioned for both trade disruption and potential Iran military action.

**Supreme Court & Trade Policy**

The Court's rejection of the AIPA tariff framework eliminates fentanyl-related and reciprocal levies, creating immediate winners and losers in global trade flows.

- Trump pivoted to Section 122 emergency authority, implementing 15% tariffs globally with a 150-day limit
- $130-170B in previously collected duties now potentially subject to refund litigation
- China's effective tariff rate drops to ~24% (Morgan Stanley estimate) from higher previous levels
- Legal uncertainty surrounds refund process - Justice Kavanaugh called it "very messy" with unclear timeline
- Trump faces Congress this week for State of the Union address after losing key trade leverage

**Market Response**

Asian equities surged on the tariff relief while US markets weakened on policy chaos and reduced presidential flexibility.

- Hang Seng Tech +4% after Friday's -4% selloff, testing 200-day moving average support
- Korea KOSPI +1.5%, extending rally to 6 of 7 sessions YTD despite trading at 0.3x P/B
- Hong Kong property +3% (Sung Hung Kai), marking ninth consecutive weekly gain - longest since 2003
- Indian equities rallied as textiles, auto parts, and chemicals benefit from lower effective rates
- US equity futures -0.7% as tariff uncertainty weighs on corporate decision-making

**Dollar & Fixed Income**

The Supreme Court ruling undermined Trump's trade leverage, triggering broad-based dollar weakness.

- Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index down 0.2%, with weakness across EUR, JPY, and CHF
- EUR/USD rising supported by eurozone current account surplus doubling in December
- 10-year Treasury yields rangebound at 4.47% despite modest flight-to-quality bid
- Markets price 50% probability of four H2 rate cuts versus baseline two cuts
- Treasury curve positioned for bull steepening as Fed cuts support front end

**Commodities**

Gold extended gains on dual catalysts while oil declined as Iran strike risks appeared contained.

- Gold +1-2% reaching $5,158/oz, up 6% over four sessions on trade uncertainty and Iran risk
- Oil (Brent) -1.2% to $71/bbl as traders price limited Iran strike scenario
- Geneva nuclear talks Thursday offer diplomatic off-ramp despite massive US military buildup
- Bitcoin -3.5% to ~$87k, down 50% from peak as risk appetite wanes

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

Central bank positioning remains dovish despite growth strength, with Waller speaking today.

- Fed expected to remain on extended hold near-term but aggressive H2 easing if growth softens
- Market pricing ~2 cuts for 2025 with governors dovish, regional presidents hawkish
- Powell insulation may increase as Supreme Court pushes back on unitary executive theory

**Corporate Developments**

Earnings and guidance reflected mixed sentiment amid trade policy uncertainty.

- Novo Nordisk -13% premarket after weight-loss drug trial missed versus Eli Lilly (+4%)
- VF Corp -3.5% on tariff uncertainty despite prior three-session rally
- Private equity faces $3.8T unsold asset overhang with distributions at 14% of NAV
- AI disruption spreading beyond software, pressuring cybersecurity stocks and SaaS pricing power

**Geopolitical Risks**

Iran tensions remain elevated despite diplomatic efforts, while trade relationships face renewed strain.

- Trump considering "limited" military action with largest US force buildup since 2003 Iraq War
- Strait of Hormuz closure risk threatens 20-25% of seaborne oil flows
- EU trade deal ratification freeze risk as European Parliament considers suspending Turnberry agreement
- Xi-Trump summit scheduled for late March with China holding increased leverage

**Outlook**

The 150-day tariff window creates a policy cliff requiring Congressional approval to extend. Corporate decision paralysis may defer capex and hiring decisions, supporting the case for bonds over risk assets. Markets appear positioned for continued dollar weakness and defensive positioning into H2 rate cuts, with gold benefiting from both trade uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.
