**Tech & Semiconductors**

Taiwan Semiconductor delivered a strong beat on Q4 earnings and issued capex guidance of $52-56 billion for 2026, representing a 70% year-over-year increase and well above the $40-60 billion consensus range. The company expects revenue growth of approximately 30% and gross margins of 63-65% versus estimates of 59.6%. TSMC's CEO confirmed AI demand visibility through 2028, though admitted uncertainty about whether demand is "real" given the massive $56 billion spend despite record orders.

The guidance sparked a semiconductor rally, with Applied Materials, Entegris, and KLA posting their best day since April. NASDAQ 100 futures showed strong momentum on the TSMC read-through, with Nvidia leading the Mag 7 higher. Analysts raised consensus price targets on TSMC by 7% to 2,150, implying 15% upside.

However, concerns are emerging about customer concentration risk, with TSMC highly dependent on Nvidia and a small group of hyperscalers. Some analysts warn that failure to demonstrate software monetization from AI infrastructure spending could undermine the thesis later in 2024.

**Oil & Geopolitics**

WTI crude plunged 5% to break below $60 per barrel after Trump delayed planned military strikes against Iran. The president claimed Iranian killings had stopped based on a phone call, though this remained unverified. Trump has previously stated he wants oil at $53 per barrel, and the geopolitical risk premium that had built up is now unwinding.

Iran faces significant internal pressure with protests that have reportedly killed over 10,000 people being crushed by authorities. US military assets have been stretched thin, with forces moved from the Middle East to the Caribbean for potential Venezuela operations.

**Small Cap Rotation**

Small caps extended their winning streak to nine consecutive days of outperformance versus large caps - the longest such streak since 2017. The Russell 2000 gained 1.2% while the S&P 500 rose just 0.4%. Equal-weight sectors also outperformed, with the equal-weight S&P 500 up 0.5% versus the cap-weighted index at 0.2%.

The rotation reflects extreme valuation disparities, with large cap CAPE ratios near 40 (close to the all-time high of 44) while small caps trade at relative discounts. Transportation stocks gained 1.8% and mid-caps rose 1.3%.

**Banking Sector**

Wall Street banks delivered record earnings but sold off sharply as investors questioned sustainability after 30-50% rallies in 2025. Goldman Sachs posted record equities trading revenue of $4.3 billion, the highest in Wall Street history. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division generated $8.4 billion, beating expectations.

However, bank stocks fell 1-4% on concerns about 18% cost growth rates. Jamie Dimon signaled he would remain at JPMorgan for "5+ more years" and definitively ruled out the Fed chair role, stating there's "absolutely positively no chance" he would take it. He would consider Treasury Secretary if asked.

**Federal Reserve & Politics**

The investigation into Fed Chair Powell continues to create political tensions. Trump stated there are "no plans to fire" Powell but the DOJ probe persists. GOP pushback is intensifying, with Senator Tillis threatening to block Fed nominees until the investigation is resolved.

Former Treasury Secretaries Jack Lew, Hank Paulson, Bob Rubin, and Janet Yellen, along with former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, signed a letter defending Powell and Fed independence. Rick Rieder is interviewing today for Fed Chair positions.

Market expectations for Fed cuts have collapsed from 7 to just 2 cuts in 2026. JPMorgan's Michael Feroli forecasts zero cuts with a new Fed chair appointment.

**Economic Data**

Jobless claims dropped to 198,000 versus expectations of 215,000, marking the lowest level in months. The unadjusted number was down 30,000 year-over-year, signaling continued labor market tightness. Manufacturing surveys rebounded, with the Philadelphia Fed index jumping to 12.6 from -8.8 and the Empire State index rising to 7.7 from -3.7.

Wage growth remains elevated at 4.4% for job stayers and 6.6% for job changers, though the premium for switching jobs has narrowed to less than 3 percentage points.

**China & Commodities**

China's PBOC cut structural lending rates by 25 basis points to 1.25% effective January 19, adding 500 billion yuan in re-lending for agriculture and small businesses. This represents targeted support rather than broad stimulus, constrained by record-low bank net interest margins of 1.4%.

Silver retreated 4% from recent highs near $94,000 as Trump postponed critical minerals tariffs. Gold remained supported despite the decline, with Amundi raising targets to $4,750 based on structural central bank demand.

Chinese regulators are clamping down on high-frequency trading, ordering brokers to remove servers from commodity exchange data centers in Shanghai and Guangzhou. This impacts firms like Citadel, Jane Street, and Jump Trading.

**Policy Initiatives**

Trump is pushing a 10% credit card interest rate cap, reportedly calling Elizabeth Warren for support. Banks warn this could trigger credit contraction and recession risk, echoing concerns from Carter-era credit controls in 1980.

A US-Taiwan trade deal is in development, featuring tariff cuts to 15% and a $500 billion semiconductor financing pledge including $250 billion in direct investment.
