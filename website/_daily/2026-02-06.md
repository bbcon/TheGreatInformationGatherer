Tech capex panic deepened as Amazon's $200B AI spending plan for 2026 triggered indiscriminate selling across software and crypto, with markets reassessing the sustainability of historic hyperscaler investment levels totaling $650B combined.

**Equities & Tech Selloff**

The selloff broadened beyond mega-cap tech as Amazon's capex guidance ($200B vs $146B expected) compounded fears sparked by Alphabet's reaction 24 hours prior. 

- S&P 500 fell 1.4% to the 5,800s, breaking key support with majority of stocks declining
- NASDAQ 100 dropped 1.6%, with over 50% of constituents now below 100-day moving averages for the first time since November
- Software sector faced historic selloff despite Atlassian beating expectations - Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Adobe trading as if "structurally broken"
- Amazon shares plunged 11% after hours despite AWS growing 24% (vs 21% expected) as investors questioned AI monetization timelines
- Bright spots included XPO (+5% to record high), Tapestry (+8% on Coach brand strength), and Roblox (+20% after hours)

Asian markets extended losses with Korea's Kospi falling 5% intraday before recovering to -1.5% on retail buying. Foreign selling reached a record $3.4B in a single day, marking Korea's first weekly loss of 2026.

**Crypto & Digital Assets**

Bitcoin crashed below $63K, falling 10% in the session and 50% from its recent peak as leverage unwound rapidly.

- Strategy Inc reported $12.3B mark-to-market loss as digital asset treasury model came under pressure
- Perpetual futures funding rates turned negative for the first time in months
- Bitcoin broke below several strategies' $76K cost basis, with shares down 28% weekly
- The Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) model appears broken post-ETF era, with consolidation and wind-downs likely

**Commodities**

Precious metals continued sharp declines amid broad risk-off sentiment and reduced haven demand.

- Silver fell 33% from last week's all-time high, trading below $70 with highest volatility since 1980
- Gold declined 3% spot, with futures down more sharply
- Copper futures dropped 4% while Shanghai crude fell 1% as industrial demand concerns mounted

**Fixed Income & FX**

Treasuries rallied strongly as investors sought safety amid equity market turmoil.

- 10-year yields fell 7 basis points to 4.20% in the longest duration rally since early November
- 2s10s spread widened to 71 basis points, the widest in four years
- 2-year yields declined to 3.47% as Fed cut expectations increased

Currency markets reflected regional divergence, with the yen weakening toward intervention levels at 157 against the dollar while the yuan strengthened to 6.93.

**Central Banks & Policy**

The ECB held rates unchanged with Lagarde emphasizing "balanced risks" for both growth and inflation, maintaining a meeting-by-meeting approach.

- Eurozone growth forecasts of 1.4-1.5% GDP came above expectations
- EUR/USD strength discussed but deemed within normal ranges, with 1.20 cited as a complication level for policy
- Bank of England surprised with a 5-4 dovish vote to hold rates, with Bailey endorsing 50/50 market pricing for a March cut
- Sterling suffered its worst daily drop versus the euro since August following the BoE's guidance shift

**Economic Data**

Labor market data presented mixed signals with underlying softening becoming apparent.

- US job openings fell unexpectedly to lowest levels since 2020
- Job cuts in January more than doubled year-over-year as AI displacement fears mounted
- Challenger job cuts reached highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, though concentrated in specific sectors
- Initial jobless claims remained low despite broader labor market concerns

**Geopolitical Developments**

US-Iran indirect talks began in Oman, reducing immediate military risk and oil geopolitical premiums.

- US seeks zero uranium enrichment versus previous 1-1.5% tolerance
- Oil markets declined despite geopolitical tensions as talks reduce risk premium
- Japan's election scheduled for Sunday with the Takichi coalition expected to expand its majority

**Risks & Outlook**

The AI capex boom totaling $650B across four major hyperscalers raises fundamental questions about return on investment timelines. Anthropic's new financial services model accelerated disruption fears across knowledge worker sectors, though some selloffs appear overdone given misclassified exposures. Market structure issues in crypto and systematic deleveraging in momentum strategies suggest continued near-term volatility ahead of key earnings and policy decisions.
