Global central banks rallied to defend Fed independence as the Trump administration escalated pressure on Chair Powell through DOJ subpoenas, while markets shrugged off cooler December CPI data that still showed underlying inflation stuck around 3%. Meanwhile, Asian markets surged on record volume as China hit 10-year highs and Japan's Nikkei reached new records on snap election speculation.

**Fed Independence Crisis Deepens**

The DOJ issued subpoenas to Fed Chair Powell as part of a criminal investigation, prompting an unprecedented joint statement from 11 major central banks including the ECB, Bank of England, and Reserve Bank of Australia calling Fed independence "critical." Republican Senator Tom Tillis threatened to block all Fed nominations until the probe is resolved, creating a 13-11 deadlock that could prevent Trump's Fed picks from advancing.

Former Fed chairs Bernanke and Yellen joined Powell in a rare joint defense of central bank independence, while JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that "anything that chips away at independence raises rates over time" - directly contradicting Trump's goal of lower borrowing costs. Powell's governor term runs until January 2028, meaning he could remain beyond his May 2026 chair term end even if not reappointed.

**Inflation Data Shows Persistent Stickiness**

December core CPI rose 0.2% month-over-month (below the 0.3% estimate) with the annual rate holding at 2.6%, but underlying measures showed inflation remains elevated. Super core services excluding shelter are running at approximately 3.5% annualized, while median and trimmed mean measures indicate underlying inflation around 3% - well above the Fed's 2% target.

The data remains distorted by government shutdown effects, with cellular service prices dropping 3% masking broader price pressures. NY Fed President Williams said there's "no strong pressure either way" for rate changes, expecting inflation to peak at 2.75-3% in 2026 before returning to 2% in 2027.

**Markets Price Delayed Fed Action**

Treasury markets showed little reaction to the CPI miss, with the 10-year yield steady around 4.16-4.19%. Markets now price only two rate cuts in 2026 - one in June and another in December - pushed back from earlier expectations of Q1/Q2 action. The curve continued steepening with 2s10s spreading wider, benefiting bank net interest margins.

**Banking Sector Under Political Pressure**

JP Morgan shares fell 4% despite reporting record annual profit expectations, as investment banking revenues disappointed and the bank faced new regulatory threats. Trump's proposal for a 10% credit card rate cap sent Visa and Mastercard down 4.5%, while JP Morgan's CFO said the bank would consider cutting its card business significantly if such caps were implemented.

The bank guided to $103 billion in net interest income (above the $100.3 billion estimate), with management noting that loan growth accelerated to 5-6% year-over-year from 0-1% at the start of 2025. The steepening yield curve environment supports further NIM expansion.

**Asian Markets Surge on Capital Rotation**

Chinese equities hit 10-year highs on record turnover of 3.5 trillion yuan Monday, with Tuesday's first 30 minutes generating 1.2 trillion yuan - suggesting another record session. The Shanghai Composite, CSI 300, and Shenzhen indices all reached multi-year peaks as the "sell America" trade gained momentum amid Fed uncertainty.

China's rally shifted from liquidity-driven to fundamentals-focused, with UBS forecasting 10% EPS growth and 15% upside targets. Chinese EVs rallied on news of an EU minimum pricing deal replacing tariffs, while Alibaba gained 6% and Baidu surged on plans for a $1-2 billion Hong Kong IPO of its AI chip unit Kunlun.

**Japan Election Speculation Drives Records**

The Nikkei surged 3.5% to record highs on speculation PM Takaichi will call a snap election next month to secure a mandate for fiscal expansion. The "Takaichi trade" drove the yen to 158-159 against the dollar (weakest since July 2024), with JGB yields steepening as markets priced potential stimulus packages worth 20-21 trillion yen.

Finance Minister Katyama warned about "one-way moves" in USD/JPY, but intervention risk appears limited without concrete action. The weak yen supports Japanese exporters while record stock prices boost domestic sentiment.

**Geopolitical Tensions Escalate**

Trump threatened 25% tariffs on all countries trading with Iran, directly targeting China (Iran's largest trading partner), India, Turkey, and the UAE. The Chinese embassy called the move "coercion" and vowed countermeasures, potentially derailing recent US-China trade truce efforts.

Oil prices jumped to two-month highs with Brent above $64/barrel and WTI above $60 as markets priced geopolitical premium. Iran is OPEC's fourth-largest producer, and secondary sanctions on major trading partners could disrupt global supply chains.

**Safe Haven Assets Rally**

Gold approached $2,600/ounce while silver hit record highs, gaining 2.7% as investors sought safety amid Fed uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The precious metals rally reflects growing concerns about monetary policy credibility and potential inflation from trade disruptions.

**Outlook and Risks**

The convergence of Fed independence threats, sticky inflation, geopolitical escalation, and Asian market momentum creates a complex environment. Political interference in monetary policy risks raising long-term borrowing costs just as Trump seeks lower rates for housing affordability. Meanwhile, productivity gains from AI deployment may support growth without requiring Fed easing, potentially keeping rates higher for longer than markets expect.

Key catalysts ahead include Supreme Court hearings on Fed governor removal authority, Trump's Iran tariff implementation timeline, and whether Asian equity momentum can sustain amid stretched valuations and potential policy responses to capital outflows.
