**Core CPI surprised to the downside at 0.2% MoM versus 0.3% expected, but underlying inflation remains elevated at 2.6% YoY while JP Morgan's record earnings were overshadowed by weak trading revenue guidance.**

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The December CPI print provided modest relief with core inflation at 0.2% MoM (vs 0.3% est) and 2.6% YoY, matching four-year lows. However, the data remains distorted by October's government shutdown, limiting its reliability for policy purposes.

- Super core services inflation (ex-shelter) rose 0.3% MoM, annualizing to 3.5%
- Median CPI at 3.5% annualized suggests underlying price pressures closer to 3% than 2.5%
- Fed funds futures pushed rate cut expectations from Q1 to mid-2026, pricing only two cuts for the year
- Former Fed Chair Patrick Harker stated he would not have cut in December, prioritizing inflation control over labor market softness

The DOJ probe of Fed Chair Powell escalated with subpoenas issued over building renovations, triggering an unprecedented coordinated defense from three former Fed chairs and 11 global central banks including the ECB and BoE. Republican Senator Tom Tillis threatened to block all Fed nominations until the investigation ends, creating potential gridlock for Trump's preferred appointments.

**Equities & Earnings**

US markets opened higher on the softer CPI but faded through the session as earnings disappointments emerged.

- S&P 500 fell 0.2%, Dow declined 1.0%, Nasdaq dropped 0.1%
- Financials led declines (-1.9%) despite JP Morgan reporting record $103B net interest income guidance
- JP Morgan fell 4% on weak capital markets revenue outlook, raising concerns for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reporting later this week
- Delta Air Lines dropped 5% on weak FY26 guidance, signaling potential travel sector headwinds

Energy was the standout sector (+1.5%) as geopolitical tensions supported commodity prices. Meanwhile, payment processors faced pressure on renewed credit card rate cap threats, with Visa down 4.5% and Mastercard declining.

**Commodities & FX**

Geopolitical tensions drove significant moves across commodity markets as Trump escalated rhetoric on Iran.

- WTI crude hit two-month highs above $60, Brent above $64 on reports of potential 25% tariffs on countries trading with Iran
- Gold approached record highs near $2,600/oz while silver surged to $88, both benefiting from safe-haven demand
- USD/JPY spiked to 159 as speculation mounted over a Japanese snap election in February
- The yen suffered its worst single-day decline since late 2024 on political uncertainty

Trump's tariff threats target Iran's largest trading partners including China, India, Turkey, and the UAE, potentially disrupting recent US-China trade détente efforts.

**International Markets**

Asian markets continued outperforming on capital rotation away from US dollar assets amid Fed independence concerns.

- China's Shanghai Composite reached 10-year highs with record 3.5 trillion yuan turnover
- Nikkei gained 3.5% on snap election optimism driving fiscal stimulus expectations
- MSCI China expected 12% EPS growth in 2026, with UBS forecasting 15% upside to target 100
- Chinese EVs rallied on EU minimum pricing agreements replacing tariffs, improving export margin outlook

Japanese government bond yields steepened with the 10-year up 7bps as PM Takaichi's potential ¥20-21 trillion fiscal package (largest since COVID) fueled reflation expectations.

**Corporate Developments**

Beyond JP Morgan's mixed results, several notable corporate moves emerged.

- Baidu's AI chip unit Kunlun targets $1-2B Hong Kong IPO as robo-taxi service Apollo Go scales to 250,000 rides weekly
- US-Taiwan trade deal appears imminent with reciprocal tariffs cut from 20-50% to 15%
- TSMC announced plans for 5+ additional Arizona fabrication facilities
- Defense stocks rallied with L3 Harris up 12% on $1B DoD missile investment

**Risk Assessment**

The convergence of Fed independence concerns, geopolitical tensions, and earnings season fragility creates multiple crosscurrents. While softer CPI provided temporary relief, core inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target after five years, limiting dovish policy options. The DOJ probe paradoxically may extend Powell's tenure through January 2028 if political gridlock prevents new appointments.

Iran escalation rhetoric is building risk premiums across energy and precious metals markets, while the potential collapse of US-China trade progress adds another layer of uncertainty. Japanese political developments bear watching as intervention risks rise with USD/JPY approaching 160.
