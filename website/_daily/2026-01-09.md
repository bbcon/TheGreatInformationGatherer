US equity markets closed at record highs as December payrolls came in weaker than expected but unemployment unexpectedly declined, effectively killing January Fed rate cut expectations while Trump unveiled ambitious plans for Venezuela's oil sector.

**Employment & Fed Policy**

December nonfarm payrolls registered 50,000 jobs, missing consensus expectations of 70,000 and whisper numbers around 65-66,000. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4% from the prior 4.5%, contrary to expectations for no change.

- Prior two months saw downward revisions to payroll figures
- Hourly earnings growth continued, complicating the Fed's disinflationary narrative
- January rate cut probability fell to near zero following the mixed employment data
- Market pricing now points to the first cut occurring in mid-2025
- Fed speakers Kashkari, Bostic, and Barkin are scheduled to provide commentary post-payrolls

**Equities & Sector Performance**

All major indices reached new record highs in Friday's session, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.8%, Nasdaq advancing 1.0%, and Dow adding 0.5%. Small-cap outperformance continued with the Russell 2000 up 0.8% for the day and 4.6% for the week.

**Venezuela & Energy Markets**

Trump formalized control over Venezuelan oil assets and convened major oil executives including representatives from Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips to discuss a potential $100+ billion infrastructure investment over the next decade.

- Current Venezuelan oil production stands at approximately 1 million barrels per day, down from 3.5 million in 1999

- China holds approximately $10 billion in Venezuelan debt, typically repaid through 60,000-70,000 barrels per day

**Supreme Court & Tariff Policy**

The Supreme Court postponed its ruling on Trump's IEEPA tariffs until January 15, extending market uncertainty around potential refund liabilities exceeding $100 billion.

- Betting markets assign roughly 70% odds to the Court striking down the tariff framework
- Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits seeking refunds that could total $300+ billion
- Trump administration maintains fallback options through Section 232, 301, and other trade authorities

- Alibaba gained 4% while Tencent participated in the tech rally
- China CPI reached 0.9% year-over-year in December, a 34-month high driven by food prices
