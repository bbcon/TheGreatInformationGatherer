The dollar plunged to four-year lows after Trump expressed comfort with currency weakness, while ASML delivered record bookings that reignited AI infrastructure optimism ahead of today's Fed decision.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates at 4.25-4.50% in today's 2pm ET decision, with markets pricing no cuts until June despite sticky 2.8% core PCE inflation. 

- Fed chair uncertainty weighs on policy outlook as Trump seeks a "loyalist" candidate
- Neutral rate estimates likely moved up 25-50bp given 3% GDP growth under supposedly "restrictive" policy
- Two cuts still priced for 2026, setting up potential Fed pushback against dovish expectations
- Powell faces political pressure amid ongoing DOJ probe and subpoena threats

**Currency Markets**

The dollar suffered its largest single-day decline since August 2024, falling over 1% overnight to four-year lows after Trump signaled tolerance for weakness.

- DXY hit multi-year lows as Trump said he could make the dollar move "like a yo-yo"
- EUR/USD broke through 1.20 resistance before consolidating at 1.19, highest since 2021
- USD/JPY weakened to 152 as yen intervention chatter subsided
- Currency options markets saw record volumes on EUR/JPY, signaling major positioning shifts
- ECB officials remained "vague" on euro strength concerns, suggesting tolerance for further gains

**Equities & Earnings**

Equity markets reached fresh records despite dollar weakness, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.3% and Nasdaq advancing 0.9% for a fifth consecutive day of gains.

- Small caps and cyclicals outperformed, with IWM strength signaling domestic growth optimism
- Korean market capitalization surpassed Germany to become the world's 10th largest on tech momentum
- Hang Seng Index hit 4.5-year highs, rising 2.5% on diversification flows from US assets
- Semiconductors reached new highs while software declined ~15% on AI displacement concerns
- Energy and materials led sector performance on commodity demand themes

**Technology & AI Infrastructure**

ASML delivered a massive earnings beat that validated AI infrastructure spending trends, sending semiconductor stocks surging.

- Q4 bookings reached €13.2B versus €6.85B expected, nearly doubling consensus estimates
- Record orders signal sustained AI infrastructure demand ahead of Meta and Microsoft earnings
- Memory chip shortage expected to last through 2027, supporting Samsung and SK Hynix ahead of Thursday earnings
- Chinese chipmakers announced first price hikes as supply constraints intensify
- Meta announced a $6B deal with Corning for data center fiber optic cables

**Commodities & Safe Havens**

Gold extended its winning streak to eight days, hitting new records above $5,260 as investors fled dollar exposure amid geopolitical tensions.

- Gold broke through the $5,200 level with Goldman Sachs targeting $5,400-$5,500
- Debasement trade accelerating as reserve managers actively diversify away from dollars
- Copper and Australian dollar outperformed, signaling global growth repricing
- Silver also hit new highs as precious metals benefited from dollar weakness

**Economic Data & Consumer Sentiment**

Consumer confidence collapsed to levels not seen in over a decade, raising concerns about economic momentum despite strong GDP tracking.

- Conference Board present situation reading hit worst levels in 10+ years including the pandemic
- Concerns over jobs, tariffs, and politics weighing on sentiment
- GDP tracking remains robust at 3-6% (Atlanta Fed ~5%) creating a growth-inflation disconnect
- Tax refunds averaging $2,900, potentially $1,000 higher than last year, providing ~0.5% GDP boost in H1 2026

**Geopolitical & Policy Risks**

Several political developments threaten market stability, with a government shutdown looming Friday and escalating immigration enforcement backlash.

- DHS stripped from funding bill over immigration enforcement concerns
- Iran tensions escalating with Trump's "massive armada" ultimatum for nuclear deal or strikes
- Immigration policy approval correlating tighter with overall approval ratings, raising midterm risks
- Indonesia's market crashed 7% on MSCI frontier market downgrade concerns over opaque shareholding structures

Treasury markets remained remarkably resilient despite global bond volatility, with the 10-year yield holding near 4.24% even as Japanese government bonds experienced 20-30bp moves. Foreign holdings of US Treasuries reached record highs, providing a buffer against selling pressure as the curve steepened on expectations the Fed will push back against dovish rate expectations.
