Markets reached fresh records as the dollar plunged to four-year lows following Trump's comments endorsing currency weakness, while ASML's record bookings ignited AI infrastructure optimism ahead of tonight's Fed decision.

**Dollar & FX**

The dollar suffered its steepest decline since August 2024, with the DXY falling over 1% to multi-year lows after Trump stated he could make the currency "go up or down like a yo-yo" and expressed comfort with weakness for export competitiveness.

- EUR/USD broke through 1.20 resistance to reach highest levels since 2021
- USD/JPY fell to 152, with yen at strongest since October as intervention chatter subsided
- USD/CNH declined to 6.93 as PBOC set strongest fix since August, not resisting appreciation aggressively
- Currency options markets saw record volumes as traders repositioned for sustained dollar decline

**Semiconductors & AI Infrastructure**

ASML delivered a stunning quarterly performance that reignited optimism around AI capital expenditure sustainability.

- Q4 bookings reached €13.2 billion versus €6.85 billion expected, nearly doubling estimates
- Company announced €12 billion share buyback program
- Korean memory chipmakers surged on supply shortage expectations, with SK Hynix gaining 5%
- South Korea's market capitalization overtook Germany to become the world's 10th largest on tech momentum
- Chinese chipmakers announced first price increases, validating tight supply conditions

**Equities & Market Leadership**

Equity markets extended their winning streak with broad-based gains, led by cyclical and international exposure.

- S&P 500 gained 0.3% to fresh records, now up five consecutive sessions
- Nasdaq advanced 0.9% on semiconductor strength
- Small caps and cyclicals outperformed, with IWM strength signaling domestic growth optimism
- Hang Seng reached 4.5-year highs, rising 2.5% on diversification flows from US assets
- Hong Kong financials hit record levels, with HSBC crossing $300 billion market cap milestone

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

Markets await today's Fed decision with expectations for a hold at current levels, though focus centers on guidance regarding the two rate cuts still priced for 2026.

- Fed expected to maintain rates at 4.25-4.50% range
- Market pricing shows no cuts until June despite resilient economic data
- Powell's press conference may face political questions regarding recent subpoena and Lisa Cook hearing attendance
- Fed chair succession uncertainty continues to weigh on dollar, with no clear frontrunner emerging

**Commodities & Alternative Assets**

Gold extended its winning streak to eight sessions as debasement concerns intensified alongside geopolitical tensions.

- Gold reached $5,260, up 1.5% and breaking above the $5,200 level
- Goldman Sachs maintains $5,400-$5,500 targets on continued central bank buying
- Copper and Australian dollar outperformed, signaling global growth repricing rather than pure US weakness
- Energy and materials sectors led equity market gains on commodity demand themes

**Economic Data & Corporate Developments**

Mixed signals emerged from economic indicators, with consumer confidence deteriorating despite robust GDP tracking.

- Conference Board consumer confidence showed worst present situation reading in over a decade
- Atlanta Fed GDP tracking remains around 5% despite sticky core PCE at 2.8%
- Tax refunds averaging $2,900 could provide approximately $1,000 increase, representing 0.5% GDP boost in first half 2026
- Corporate layoffs accelerated with Amazon cutting 16,000 positions and UPS eliminating 30,000 jobs

**Risks & Catalysts**

Several developments bear monitoring as potential market catalysts.

- Government shutdown risk Friday as DHS funding remains contentious over immigration enforcement
- Indonesia's JCI crashed 7% on MSCI concerns over shareholding transparency, risking frontier market downgrade
- Japan's 40-year bond auction today presents risk of JGB volatility continuation

The convergence of dollar weakness, AI infrastructure demand, and central bank policy uncertainty creates a complex backdrop for markets as the Fed prepares to signal its path forward amid political pressures and evolving economic conditions.
