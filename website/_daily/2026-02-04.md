Software stocks plunged $285 billion as AI disruption fears intensified, while economic data painted a mixed picture with ADP payrolls missing sharply despite a strong ISM Manufacturing beat.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

Fed Governor Myron resigned from the Council of Economic Advisers while remaining on the Fed board. Market attention focused on incoming Fed leadership under the Worsh nomination, with BMP Paribas expecting zero rate cuts in 2026 based on a bullish rather than hawkish stance.

- Mid-2% GDP growth expectations with modest inflation uptick from tariffs and services strength
- Balance sheet reduction likely to be "gradual and predictable" 
- Forward-looking approach expected versus strict data dependency
- Market pricing still anticipates 2 cuts versus strategist consensus of 0-1

**Economic Data**

Labor market data showed significant weakness while manufacturing surprised to the upside, creating tension in the macro narrative.

- ADP payrolls: 22K versus 45K estimate, with December revised down to 37K
- Manufacturing employment fell 8K, professional services declined 57K
- ISM Manufacturing delivered a blowout print suggesting cyclical acceleration
- Port of LA Q1 volume down 10%+ year-over-year on tough 2025 front-loading comparisons

**Equities & Earnings**

Software stocks faced existential pressure as AI automation concerns reached fever pitch, while market rotation into real economy sectors continued.

- Nine worst S&P performers year-to-date all SaaS companies, down 25%+
- Anthropic's legal documentation tool sparked fears about recurring revenue model sustainability
- Russell 2000 outperformed with +0.4-0.5% gains versus S&P +0.1%, NASDAQ -0.2%
- Equal-weight S&P led cap-weighted indices as concentration risk played out
- AMD fell 9% despite earnings beats as guidance missed elevated expectations; surprise $390M China sales from Trump export easing
- Eli Lilly gained 7% on 27% sales growth guidance versus Novo Nordisk's -13% guide
- Uber declined 6% on weak outlook and self-driving competition concerns
- Walmart reached $1 trillion market cap as AI efficiency beneficiary

**Private Credit & Credit Markets**

Private credit firms suffered their worst day since April 2025 on software exposure opacity concerns.

- KKR led declines among Apollo, TPG, and Blackstone despite varied portfolio compositions
- Software exposure increased to 20% from 10% in 2016 across the sector
- BDC default expectations could exceed 10% if AI disruption escalates
- No stress-test of underwriting standards in a credit-induced recession scenario

**Fixed Income & FX**

Bond markets remained remarkably contained despite cross-asset volatility, while international themes gained traction.

- 10-year Treasury yield at 4.27%, up just 1 basis point
- Japanese Government Bond yields spiked 20-30 basis points in single session
- Japanese banks, real estate, and insurers hit new highs on reflation trade
- Dollar strength showed signs of fading as consumer staples outperformed on FX translation benefits

**Commodities & Geopolitics**

Energy markets responded to Middle East tensions while precious metals showed extreme volatility.

- WTI crude at $63, up 2% on Iran drone shootdown near USS Lincoln
- Iranian gunboat attempted tanker seizure, escalating regional tensions
- Gold gained 1.6% in best two-day rally since 2020, following worst two-day drop since 2013
- Silver surged 5% amid continued extreme volatility

**Market Structure & Themes**

Dispersion reached extreme levels as sector rotation accelerated beyond technology concentration.

- Semiconductors versus software created 60% performance gap over six months while sector remained flat
- 280 stocks gained when S&P fell 1.2% intraday yesterday, indicating healthy breadth
- China exposure at Port of LA declined to sub-40% from 60% in 2018, yet port growth continued via diversification
- Transportation, regional banks, industrials, and materials sectors benefited from rotation into real economy

**Risk Factors**

Political constraints on AI buildout emerged as electricity price inflation created voter backlash ahead of midterms. Next-generation AI models with 10x compute power expected in spring/summer could trigger broader sectoral disruption across legal, tax, and pharmaceutical industries. Trump approval ratings declined with generic ballot showing +5 Democratic advantage and a 31-point swing in Texas special elections signaling potential midterm headwinds.
