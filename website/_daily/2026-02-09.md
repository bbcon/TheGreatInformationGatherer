Japan's new Prime Minister Takaichi secured a historic supermajority in weekend elections, triggering a 4% Nikkei rally to record highs while unexpectedly strengthening the yen to 156/USD amid intervention warnings. Separately, Chinese regulators advised banks to reduce US Treasury holdings citing concentration risks, pushing 10-year yields up 4bp to 4.24%.

**Japan Election & Policy Implications**

Takaichi's LDP won a decisive two-thirds majority, the largest mandate since WWII and sufficient to override upper house vetoes.

- Nikkei 225 surged 4% to record highs, with tech, defense, and transport sectors gaining ~10%
- USD/JPY fell to 156 despite pre-election expectations for yen weakness
- MOF Chief Currency Official Mimura warned of watching FX "with high sense of urgency" - a clear intervention signal
- Proposed sales tax cut: 8% suspension on food for 2 years (~¥5 trillion/$31B annually)
- Finance Minister claims no additional JGB issuance needed despite massive fiscal cost

**Central Bank Developments**

Market pricing for BOJ policy has shifted materially following the election outcome and recent hawkish commentary.

- Markets now price 80% probability of April BOJ hike (up from June base case)
- Rate expectations rose to 100bp from 75bp as officials signal current 0.75% may be "too accommodative"
- BOJ officials "playing down" previous 1-2.5% neutral rate range, suggesting upward revision
- JGB long-end yields stabilized on decisive election win, but short-end rose on hike expectations
- Real wage declines continue pressuring BOJ toward action despite Takaichi's loose policy preference

**Treasury Markets & Chinese Policy**

Chinese regulators advised domestic banks to limit or reduce US Treasury positions amid concentration concerns, though the directive doesn't apply to sovereign holdings.

- 10-year Treasury yields rose 4bp to 4.24% on the guidance
- China's bank Treasury holdings total $682B, down from $1.3T a decade ago
- 30-year yields approached 4.90% resistance as long-end led the selloff higher
- November data showed Japan, UK, and Canada increased Treasury holdings, with record total foreign ownership

**Equity Markets & Systematic Risk**

US equity futures pointed lower despite risk-on sentiment in Asian and European sessions.

- Goldman warns of $33B systematic selling risk if S&P declines, escalating to $80B below 5,677
- Asian markets benefited from Japan election clarity and reduced geopolitical tensions
- Novo Nordisk gained 8% in European trading after Hims&Hers abandoned Wegovy copycat following FDA crackdown

**Currency & Commodities**

The dollar weakened across majors despite Treasury yield gains, with commodity markets mixed on geopolitical developments.

- DXY declined as yen strength offset Treasury market moves
- Gold rose 1.5% above $5,000/oz on dollar weakness and safe-haven demand
- Brent crude fell toward $67/bbl as Iran-US talks in Oman were described as a "step forward"
- Treasury Secretary Bessent cited Chinese speculative excess behind recent gold volatility, with margin requirements tightened

**UK Political Crisis**

Prime Minister Starmer faces mounting pressure as his chief of staff resigned over the Mandelson appointment ahead of critical May elections.

- GBP weakened on political uncertainty and cabinet resignation threats
- Union leaders calling for Starmer's exit as Reform UK polls ahead in some constituencies
- BOE dovish split last week adding pressure on sterling alongside political turmoil

**Data & Event Risk**

This week brings a condensed calendar of delayed US economic releases following the government shutdown.

- Retail sales (Tuesday), delayed January payrolls (Wednesday), CPI (Friday)
- Economists expect weak hiring and spending with elevated inflation - potential stagflation signal
- Munich Security Conference on Friday presents geopolitical risk around NATO/Ukraine discussions
- Real wage pressures in Japan adding urgency to BOJ policy normalization

The day's developments highlight several key tensions: Japan's fiscal expansion plans against JGB market constraints, China's Treasury guidance amid record foreign ownership, and UK political instability heading into crucial local elections. Currency intervention risks appear elevated above USD/JPY 156, while systematic selling pressures loom over US equities if key technical levels break.
