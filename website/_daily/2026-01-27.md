Treasury markets sold off as the dollar posted its worst day since April, falling 1.3% after Trump explicitly endorsed currency weakness, while equity markets hit records despite deteriorating breadth that signals growing concentration risk ahead of key earnings.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve's policy decision tomorrow at 2pm is expected to hold rates unchanged, with Chair Powell's 2:30pm press conference likely the final appearance of his tenure. Fed Chair selection between Kevin Reer and Kevin Warsh could come as soon as tomorrow, with market implications for policy direction.

- Reer candidacy implies lower short rates and reflationary bias
- Warsh viewed as hawkish on balance sheet management but dovish on long-term rates
- Fed balance sheet expansion continues replacing T-bills with reserves, effectively stealth QE supporting reflationary assets

**Currency & Fixed Income**

The dollar collapsed 1.3% to 2022 lows after Trump stated he's "not concerned" about dollar weakness, effectively green-lighting further declines. Options markets are pricing record-high hedging costs for additional dollar weakness since Bloomberg data began in 2011.

- 30-year Treasury yields rose 4bp to 4.8%, flirting with 5% despite curve positioning
- Bond fund positioning has shifted from negative to positive steepener exposure since July
- Real yields at 3.2% mark highest levels since early 2000s

**Equities & Earnings**

The S&P 500 gained 0.4% to fresh records, but underlying breadth turned sharply negative with 269 stocks declining versus 234 advancing. The Nasdaq 100 posted its fifth consecutive gain of 1%, driven by concentration into Mag 7 stocks ahead of Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla earnings tomorrow.

- Russell 2000 managed just 0.1% gain, showing continued small-cap weakness
- Healthcare sector plunged 1.7% on Medicare rate shock
- Gold outperformed equities despite index gains, classic risk-off signal

**Healthcare & Regulatory**

Medicare Advantage rate proposals for 2027 shocked markets with a 0.09% increase versus expected 5-6% rises, though the proposal is not yet final. Major insurers were crushed on margin compression fears.

- UnitedHealth fell 19.6%, Humana declined 21%, CVS dropped 14%
- Final Medicare rates due early April following industry lobbying period
- Rate proposal threatens 2027 earnings across health insurance sector

**Trade & Geopolitics**

Trump issued fresh 25% tariff threats against South Korea, though historical data shows only 27% of such threats materialize. The EU-India Free Trade Agreement was finalized after 20 years of negotiations, covering 20% of global GDP as trade blocs diversify away from US dependency.

- Korean KOSPI initially fell 1% before recovering to close up 2%
- SK Hynix surged 8% as sole HBM3 supplier to Microsoft's Maya chips
- EU-India deal eliminates tariffs on 96.6% of EU exports, cutting German auto tariffs from 110% to 10%

**Commodities**

Gold broke through $5,100/oz to new highs as the "debasement trade" accelerated alongside dollar weakness. Energy markets showed divergence with natural gas spiking 35% on Arctic weather while oil extended losses.

- Silver held above $112/oz despite volatility
- Brent crude at $65/barrel on oversupply outlook despite weather disruptions
- US natural gas front-month premium signals transient weather event

**Global Outlook**

Economic fundamentals remain constructive globally with recession risk below 20% absent exogenous shocks. M&A activity is positioned for potentially record levels in 2026 as regulatory environment improves, while IPO pipelines strengthen across US, Europe, and Hong Kong markets.

- AI productivity gains broadening beyond tech into enterprise applications
- Hong Kong tech IPO momentum sustainable with tighter regulatory standards improving quality
- Japan showing structural shift toward outward-looking economy after 30-year stagnation
