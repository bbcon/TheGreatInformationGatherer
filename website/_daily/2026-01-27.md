Trump's explicit endorsement of dollar weakness triggered a 1.3% plunge in the DXY to two-year lows, while equities reached fresh records despite deteriorating breadth signaling dangerous concentration ahead of key tech earnings.

**Dollar & FX**

The dollar suffered its worst single-day decline since mid-April after Trump stated he's "not concerned" about currency weakness, effectively green-lighting further devaluation. 

- DXY fell 1.3% to lowest levels since 2022
- Options market pricing record-high cost to hedge further dollar weakness since 2011
- EUR and GBP both touching 2021 highs as Trump cited China and Japan currency devaluation as justification
- Korean won under pressure despite equity resilience following 25% tariff threat on South Korea

**Equities & Earnings**

Major indices hit new records but underlying market health deteriorated sharply, with breadth turning negative despite index gains.

- S&P 500 gained 0.4% to fresh record but breadth was negative: 234 stocks up, 269 down
- Nasdaq 100 rose 1% for fifth straight session, driven by concentration into Mag 7 ahead of Meta and Microsoft earnings Tuesday
- Russell 2000 managed just 0.1% gain as small-cap bleeding stopped but conviction remains absent
- KOSPI initially fell 1% on tariff news but reversed to close up 2% as investors bought the dip
- SK Hynix surged 8% as sole HBM3 supplier to Microsoft's Maya chips
- Asian equities near record highs despite geopolitical noise

**Healthcare Selloff**

Medicare Advantage rate proposal for 2027 shocked the sector, though final rates aren't due until April.

- UnitedHealth plunged 19.6%, Humana fell 21%, CVS dropped 14%
- Proposed 2027 rates show just 0.09% increase versus 5-6% expectations
- Healthcare sector declined 1.7% overall
- Final rate decision expected in early April after industry lobbying

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday with no change expected, but Fed Chair succession and balance sheet expansion remain market focus.

- Fed decision at 2pm Tuesday with Powell press conference at 2:30pm
- Fed Chair race between Reer (reflationary, lower short rates) and Warsh (hawkish on balance sheet)
- Fed balance sheet expansion effectively acting as stealth QE, fueling gold, stocks, and real estate
- Two rate cuts expected for 2026, though strong growth could reduce easing

**Commodities**

Gold broke through $5,000 to reach $5,100/oz as the debasement trade accelerated, while energy markets remained volatile.

- Gold hitting new highs on dollar weakness and geopolitical risk premium
- Silver above $112/oz with continued volatility  
- Brent crude at $65/barrel, extending losses on oversupply outlook despite weather disruptions
- US natural gas spiked 35% Monday on Arctic blast but front-month premium signals transient weather event

**Global Trade Realignment**

The EU-India FTA finalized after 20 years represents a significant shift as nations diversify away from US trade relationships.

- Deal covers 20% of global GDP, eliminating/reducing tariffs on 96.6% of EU exports
- German auto tariffs drop from 110% to 10%, wine tariffs fall from 150% to 75%
- UK-China trade talks advancing as part of broader diversification trend
- Only 27% of Trump tariff threats have materialized, reducing market impact of new announcements

**Bond Markets**

Treasury yields rose at the long end despite curve steepening positioning, with the 30-year approaching 5%.

- 30-year Treasury yield up 4bps to 4.8%, flirting with 5% again
- Bond funds shifted to positive steepener exposure from negative positioning since July
- Real yields at 3.2% represent highest levels since early 2000s
- Japanese 40-year JGB auction Wednesday poses intervention risk if poorly received

**M&A & Capital Markets**

Corporate activity is positioning for potentially record M&A levels in 2026 as regulatory environment improves.

- M&A backlog significantly elevated with CEOs feeling "unleashed" to invest
- IPO pipeline very strong across US, Europe, and Hong Kong markets
- Hong Kong seeing sustainable momentum in tech/AI infrastructure listings
- Capital markets expected to have highly constructive year for both M&A and fundraising
