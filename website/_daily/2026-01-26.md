Dollar weakness accelerated following unprecedented coordinated Fed-BOJ intervention signals, with USD/JPY falling from 159 to 154 as gold breached $5,000 for the first time amid mounting geopolitical and fiscal pressures.

**Equities & Earnings Setup**

**Central Banks & Policy**

The Fed faces its first major decision of 2026 Wednesday with no rate change expected but increased focus on personnel uncertainty and intervention coordination.

- No rate cut priced for Wednesday; next easing expected in June
- Market pricing 1-2 cuts for 2026 with 3%+ terminal rate
- Five contenders for Fed Chair position with Trump seeking "unicorn" candidate
- ECB rate cut risks rising as inflation already below 2% target, could fall to 1.5-1.7%
- Bank of England likely to deliver more cuts than priced as labor market weakens

- UnitedHealth down 14%, CVS down 10%, Humana down 14% in after-hours trading

- Democrats blocking DHS funding after Minneapolis ICE shooting; shutdown deadline Friday
- China military purge deepened with top general Zhang Youxia under investigation

- Trump speech and potential government shutdown deadline Friday

The combination of coordinated intervention signals, record gold levels, and healthcare sector disruption suggests heightened volatility ahead as markets navigate multiple crosscurrents simultaneously.
