The Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady next week as markets stabilized following Trump's Greenland tariff deescalation and a framework deal announcement that triggered a broad risk-on rally, though defensive positioning persists with gold hitting records near $2,800.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Supreme Court signaled skepticism of Trump's push to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, with both liberal and conservative justices questioning administration arguments. Fed Chair Powell faces continued political pressure, with Trump stating "If he won't leave, I won't make his life happy," though no immediate removal mechanism exists. The race for Fed Chair is narrowing, with Trump calling Rieder and Warsh "good options" and potentially announcing next week.

Market pricing shows only 2 rate cuts for 2025, down from prior expectations. Central bankers signed a solidarity statement supporting Powell amid the independence concerns.

**Markets & Equities**

The S&P 500 gained 1.1% (session highs +1.6%) as Trump dialed back tariff threats and announced a Greenland "framework deal." The Russell 2000 extended its dominance to 13 consecutive sessions of outperformance, up 1.8%, driven by broadening earnings growth with 9 of 11 sectors now showing positive growth versus only 2 in Q2.

Semiconductors surged 3% with Intel jumping 12% ahead of earnings to its highest level in 4 years. However, software declined for the 7th straight day, marking the longest streak since 2022, despite the broader rally. The Nasdaq 100 gained 1.6%.

VIX collapsed 3 points to the 16 handle as systematic strategies covered shorts, though discretionary investors remain neutral for 6-8 months per Deutsche Bank. The rally failed to fully recoup yesterday's losses when the S&P erased all 2025 gains.

**Fixed Income & Currencies**

Treasury yields fell 4 basis points on the 10-year despite the risk-on tone, with the 30-year at 4.85% down from the 4.30% peak on the 10-year. However, analysts note a "quiet quitting" of US bonds by foreign buyers, representing diversification away from US assets without mass selling. European holders of over $3 trillion in Treasuries create potential weaponization risk.

The dollar weakened as Trump wants a weaker currency. The yuan strengthened with the PBOC setting a weaker CNY fixing at 7.14, though still no move below 7.0. Dollar/yen traded around 158, below intervention thresholds after Japanese Finance Minister Katayyama's verbal intervention.

**Japan Crisis Stabilizes**

Japan's JGB crisis temporarily stabilized following Katayyama's Davos intervention, though underlying fiscal concerns persist. The 40-year JGB yield gained 10 basis points but stabilized after Tuesday's historic 6-sigma selloff. Markets continue pricing normalization toward 3.5-4% from current levels around 2%.

The BOJ decision Friday remains critical, with analysts expecting 3-5 rate hikes over 18 months to reach neutral policy around 2.5-3% from the current 0.75%. Japan achieved its first primary balance surplus in 28 years, though consumption tax cut plans create a $32 billion revenue hole.

**Commodities & Safe Havens**

Gold hit record highs near $2,800 despite the equity rally, with Goldman upgrading its target to $5,600 (from $4,800) on institutional and retail demand layering onto central bank buying. Platinum reached $2,511, also a record. Natural gas futures surged 27% - the biggest one-day jump since 2022 - on a cold snap hitting the East Coast and Gulf regions.

The defensive bid in gold persists despite risk-on moves elsewhere, signaling elevated hedging demand and underlying market fragility.

**Economic Data**

Pending home sales fell the most since April 2020 in December, creating a disconnect with mortgage applications at 2023 highs. This highlights ongoing housing demand/supply imbalances. China announced $72 billion in SME loan guarantees through a 2-year facility targeting equipment and technology upgrades to boost domestic consumption.

US GDP growth was revised to 4.4% for Q3, above estimates, while jobless claims came in at 200,000, slightly higher but below the 209,000 estimate. Bank of America upgraded its 2026 GDP forecast to 2.8% from 1.5% and reported 5% year-over-year consumer spending growth in Q4 across its 70 million customer base.

**Geopolitics & Policy**

Trump's Greenland tensions eased after G7 allies pushed back publicly for the first time, though European leaders signal lasting damage to transatlantic relations. The pattern of grand threats followed by market selloffs and subsequent walk-backs continues, with investors learning to fade initial headlines while volatility persists.

Trump pivoted on credit card caps, now seeking Congressional authority versus executive orders after banking lobby mobilization. Jamie Dimon warned 80% of Americans could lose credit access if a 10% cap were implemented.

**Corporate & Credit**

Private equity exits accelerated with $1.3 trillion returned to LPs in 2025, representing 80% of the 2021 peak as the IPO window reopens. The secondaries market is booming, highlighted by EQT's $3.2 billion Collar Capital deal.

Credit spreads remain tight overall but dispersion is rising in triple-C space, signaling late-cycle concerns. The Port of Long Beach handled a record 9.9 million containers with 5% growth despite tariff uncertainty.

Q4 earnings show broadening growth beyond mega-cap tech, validating the small-cap rotation. However, software and mega-cap multiples remain at the 99th percentile historically, with Microsoft and Apple earnings next week providing critical tests for the market's leadership.
