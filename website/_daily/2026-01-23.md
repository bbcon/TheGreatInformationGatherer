Federal Reserve policymakers appear set to hold rates steady at next week's meeting while markets extended their rebound, though Intel's after-hours collapse threatens the AI rotation narrative that has supported tech stocks.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The January 29 FOMC meeting is expected to deliver no rate changes, with fed funds futures pricing no cuts until June. Q4 GDP revisions came in better than expected, but the Fed's preferred PCE inflation measure remains stuck near 3%, well above target.

- Personal spending showed strength in Q4, but disposable incomes were flat after inflation adjustment
- Low and moderate income households face continued pressure as wages rise nominally but purchasing power stagnates
- Labor market softening continues, according to Huntington Bank's CEO, maintaining the moderating trend

The Bank of Japan decision overnight draws heightened focus following this week's JGB selloff, with dysfunction in ultra-long bonds raising questions about potential QT adjustments.

**Equities & Earnings**

The S&P 500 gained 0.5% as markets extended their rebound from Tuesday's selloff, but Intel's after-hours crash cast doubt on tech's recovery momentum.

- Tech rebounded 0.7% with Global X AI ETF posting its best two-day gain in a month
- DataDog, Microsoft, and Dell recorded their strongest sessions since November
- Small caps outperformed for the 14th consecutive session, with Russell 2000 up 0.8% - an unprecedented streak
- Energy leads all sectors year-to-date with 9.4% gains, driven by natural gas infrastructure buildout
- Mag 7 forward P/E sits at 28x, in the mid-range of its 2018-present band

Intel plunged 7% after hours following weak guidance that threatens the AI broadening thesis. Q1 EPS guidance of $0 missed estimates of $0.08, while revenue guidance of $11.7-12.7 billion fell short of the $12.6 billion consensus. CEO Pat Gelsinger admitted yields are "not up to standards" and supply constraints limit the company's ability to meet strong order demand. The critical 18A process still lacks volume customer commitments.

**Fixed Income & FX**

The 10-year Treasury yield held steady after recent volatility, while defensive positioning remains elevated across options markets.

- VIX call open interest sits near March highs with strikes clustered at 30-35 for mid-February expiration - double current levels
- Break-even inflation rates leaked wider but remained contained
- Front-end Treasury demand persists, with SGOV attracting $40 billion in 2025 inflows

**China & Asia**

China's yuan fixed sub-7.0 for the first time since May 2023, signaling a policy shift toward currency strength as the PBOC targets 10% of global FX reserves versus current levels.

- Alibaba surged 4-5% on plans to IPO its T-Head AI chipmaking unit, joining a wave of tech listings
- Hong Kong property stocks posted their biggest monthly outperformance versus the Hang Seng Index in five years
- China small caps accelerated higher with the Star 50 index reaching 2021 highs and Beijing 50 up 2.2%
- PopMart gained 24% week-to-date for its best week since 2022

**Commodities**

Precious metals continued their parabolic advance amid geopolitical hedging and dollar weakness.

- Silver approached $100/oz, up 40% year-to-date
- Gold neared $5,000/oz with Goldman Sachs raising its target to $5,400
- China silver exports hit 5,100 tons in 2024, the highest in 16+ years, contradicting supply tightening concerns

**Geopolitics & Policy**

US-led Ukraine peace talks gained momentum with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff meeting Vladimir Putin for over four hours, though territory remains a key sticking point.

- Trilateral talks planned in Abu Dhabi represent the first potential US-Russia-Ukraine meeting
- EU-US trade deal appears back on track after the Greenland crisis, though European officials describe the transatlantic relationship as "permanently damaged"
- Trump's proposed 10% credit card rate cap threatens $121 billion in industry revenue, with BofA and Citi considering new 10% products for super-prime customers

**Risks Ahead**

Intel's guidance miss undermines the AI participation thesis just as markets showed signs of broadening beyond mega-cap tech. The company's admission of execution issues and lack of 18A customer wins raises questions about its foundry strategy. Meanwhile, elevated VIX call positioning suggests high conviction for a volatility spike, with options markets pricing significant upside in coming weeks.
