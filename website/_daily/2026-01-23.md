U.S. markets extended their rebound with the S&P 500 gaining 0.5%, but Intel's after-hours crash on weak guidance threatened the AI rotation narrative as President Trump's "Board of Peace" launched in Davos with broader geopolitical tensions showing signs of easing.

**Fed & Monetary Policy**

The Federal Reserve's January 29 meeting approaches with no rate cut expected, as fed funds futures price no cuts until June. Q4 GDP came in better than expected, but PCE inflation remains stuck near 3% - the Fed's preferred measure - while personal spending was strong but disposable incomes flat after inflation adjustment. Powell's credibility remains intact despite lingering concerns over Fed independence, with the Supreme Court signaling skepticism of Trump's push to fire Governor Lisa Cook. Both liberal and conservative justices questioned the administration's authority during recent hearings.

The Bank of Japan decision looms as a key risk event after this week's JGB market dysfunction, where $41 billion was wiped out from just $280 million in trading - what Treasury Secretary Bessent called a "six-standard deviation move." The 10-year Treasury yield held steady at 4.24%, down from recent peaks near 4.30%, as bond volatility subsided following Japan's stabilization.

**Equities & Earnings**

Small caps outperformed for the 14th consecutive session, with the Russell 2000 gaining 0.8% - an unprecedented streak suggesting conviction in the rotation trade. Tech rebounded 0.7% after Tuesday's selloff, with the Global X AI ETF posting its best two-day gain in a month. Data Dog, Microsoft, and Dell all recorded their best days since November.

However, Intel's after-hours crash of 7% following weak guidance poses a significant threat to the AI broadening thesis. The company guided Q1 EPS to $0 versus estimates of $0.08, with revenue expected at $11.7-12.7 billion against $12.6 billion estimates. CEO Pat Gelsinger admitted yields are "not up to standards" and supply constraints are limiting the company's ability to meet demand despite strong orders. The critical 18A process still lacks volume customer commitments.

Cyclicals showed strength with Caterpillar and Rollins hitting record highs, while Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly, and Wells Fargo posted strong gains. Energy led all sectors year-to-date with a 9.4% gain, driven by natural gas infrastructure buildout for AI data center power needs.

**Geopolitics & Policy**

Trump's Board of Peace officially launched in Davos with approximately 20 countries signing on to oversee Gaza reconstruction and potentially broader conflicts. The initiative includes a controversial $1 billion permanent membership fee and faces pushback from Netanyahu regarding Qatar and Turkey involvement, while questions remain about Putin's inclusion and enforcement mechanisms.

Geopolitical tensions showed signs of easing as Trump deescalated Greenland tensions after G7 allies pushed back publicly for the first time. The administration canceled EU tariffs set for February 1st after reaching a "framework deal" focused on Arctic security rather than sovereignty. However, European leaders signal a potential permanent shift in transatlantic relations, with Canada's Carney calling it a "rupture, not a transition."

US-led Ukraine peace talks are accelerating, with Kushner and Witkoff meeting Putin for over four hours and trilateral talks planned in Abu Dhabi. Territory remains the key sticking point, with Russia showing no concessions while Ukraine has offered some flexibility.

**Commodities & FX**

Gold approached $5,000 per ounce as Goldman Sachs raised its year-end target by 10% to $5,400, citing persistent geopolitical risks and structural demand from central banks plus retail and institutional buyers. Silver surged near $100 per ounce, up 40% year-to-date in an extreme move reflecting geopolitical hedging and dollar weakness.

China's yuan was fixed sub-7.0 for the first time since May 2023, with the PBOC signaling policy shift toward currency strength as it targets 10% of global FX reserves versus current levels. The dollar faced its worst week since June despite some stabilization.

Natural gas futures surged 70% this week to the highest levels since 2022 on cold weather and supply risks.

**Credit & Corporate Developments**

Defensive positioning remains elevated with VIX call open interest near March highs, with strikes clustered at 30-35 for mid-February expiry - double current levels - suggesting high conviction for a volatility spike ahead.

Corporate issuance remains heavy with strong investment-grade demand, though triple-C spreads are widening as late-cycle credit dispersion rises. Trump's proposed 10% credit card rate cap continues to overhang financial stocks, with Bank of America and Citi reportedly weighing new cards with 10% rates for super-prime customers only. The industry faces $121 billion in revenue at risk.

**Key Corporate Moves**

EQT is acquiring Collar Capital for $3.2 billion as the secondaries market booms, while Alibaba is preparing an IPO for its T-Head AI chipmaking unit. In Hong Kong, PopMart surged 24% for its best week since 2022 ahead of a CEO interview, while property stocks showed their biggest monthly outperformance versus the Hang Seng in five years as commercial rents posted their first quarter-over-quarter pickup.

Markets face critical tests ahead with Intel's guidance miss threatening the AI narrative, ongoing geopolitical negotiations that could shift sentiment quickly, and the BOJ decision that will determine whether recent bond market calm can hold.
