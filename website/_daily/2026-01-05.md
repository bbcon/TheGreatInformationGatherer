The Trump administration seized control of Venezuela over the weekend, ousting Maduro and installing acting president Deli Rodriguez, with markets rallying on AI optimism while energy stocks surged on potential oil sector revival.

**Venezuela Regime Change & Energy Markets**

US forces captured Venezuelan leader Maduro in what sources described as a clean military operation, with Trump demanding the US "runs everything" in Venezuela to access the country's oil reserves.

- Venezuelan oil production currently at 800K-900K barrels per day, down from 2.5M bpd pre-collapse and 4M bpd at peak
- Market estimates 250K bpd short-term uplift potential, reaching 1.3-1.4M bpd within 2 years, though meaningful restoration requires 5-8 years and tens of billions in investment
- Brent crude traded mixed around $61/barrel, with WTI flat as traders weighed limited near-term supply impact against long-term potential
- China purchased 300M barrels of Venezuelan oil through December 2024, providing supply buffer that limits immediate disruption risk

**Equity Markets & Sector Rotation**

US markets posted broad gains led by cyclicals and energy, with the Dow hitting record highs while tech lagged despite AI optimism in Asia.

- S&P 500 +0.6% to ~6,040, Dow +1.2% (~600 points) to record intraday and closing highs
- Russell 2000 +1.6%, outperforming large caps in risk-on rotation
- Energy sector surged: Chevron +5-6%, Halliburton +8%, SLB +9%, Valero +9% on Venezuela exposure
- US shale producers declined: Diamondback -3.5%, Devon Energy lower on oversupply concerns
- Oil services (OSX) posted best day since April 2024, reaching multi-month highs
- Defense stocks rallied on geopolitical tensions: Rheinmetall +7%
- Financials hit record highs ahead of earnings season
- Pharma sector suffered worst day since September: Eli Lilly -3.6%

**Asian Markets & Tech Rally**

Asian equities hit records on AI infrastructure optimism, with tech-heavy indices leading gains despite geopolitical uncertainty.

- MSCI Asia Pacific reached record high, Taiwan +2%, South Korea +3% approaching 5,000 target
- TSMC +3-5% after Goldman raised price target 35% on multi-year AI growth prospects
- Samsung +4.5-6% on HBM4 chip optimism and "Samsung is back" narrative ahead of Thursday earnings
- Chinese markets mixed: CSI 300 +0.8%, yuan fixed below 7.0 for first time since September 2024

**Commodities & Safe Havens**

Precious metals surged on geopolitical uncertainty while base metals continued recent strength.

- Gold +1.5-1.9% above $2,400/oz near record highs, silver +3.6-6% outperforming
- Copper +3-4% breaking $13,000, extending best year since 2009 (+42% in 2025)
- Aluminum hit $3,000, highest since 2022 on supply concerns
- Nuclear fuel stocks surged after $2.7B government funding announcement: LEU +10%, Sillex +11%

**Treasury Markets & Dollar**

Bond markets rallied modestly while the dollar showed limited safe-haven bid despite geopolitical developments.

- 10-year Treasury yield declined 2-4 basis points to 4.17%, with longer end outperforming
- Dollar Index +0.2-0.25%, showing muted reaction after worst G10 performance in 2025 (-10%)
- Positioning remains light following last year's losses, limiting upside momentum

**Central Bank Outlook**

Markets continue pricing approximately two Fed cuts for 2026, though multiple strategists expect zero cuts under Powell's remaining tenure through May.

- Fed faces competing pressures from potential tariff-driven inflation (30-50 bps added to core PCE) versus labor market fragility
- Friday's payrolls report remains key catalyst, with consensus around 59K after recent volatility
- BOJ Governor Ueda speaking Monday ahead of January meeting focus

**Risks & Uncertainties**

Venezuela's transition faces significant challenges despite initial market optimism about oil sector revival.

- Acting President Rodriguez described as "Madurismo without Maduro," with existing power structures including military and Cuban security forces remaining intact
- Legal and political uncertainty may delay required tens of billions in oil infrastructure investment
- Broader geopolitical implications as Trump administration asserts "Monroe Doctrine 2.0" with Cuba potentially next target
- Venezuelan bonds trading at 33 cents on dollar present high-risk restructuring opportunity if economic turnaround proves credible

The regime change represents a potential multi-year energy story rather than immediate supply disruption, with markets correctly focusing on infrastructure rebuilding timelines over headline reserve figures. Energy service companies and Gulf Coast refiners equipped for heavy crude appear best positioned to benefit from any eventual production restoration.
