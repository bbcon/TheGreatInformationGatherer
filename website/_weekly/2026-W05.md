The dollar posted its worst week since April as coordinated Fed-BOJ intervention signals and explicit presidential endorsement of currency weakness drove the greenback to four-year lows, while equity markets touched historic highs amid a stark divergence in AI investment returns that separated technology winners from laggards.

**Dollar Collapse and Coordinated Intervention**

The week began with unprecedented peacetime coordination between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan conducting joint "rate checks" - the first such signal since 2011. This intervention threat, combined with Trump's explicit comfort with dollar weakness, triggered a historic currency selloff.

- USD/JPY plummeted from 159 to 152, with the yen gaining over 5% on intervention speculation
- Bloomberg Dollar Index fell 3.2% for the week to September lows, marking the worst performance since April
- EUR/USD broke through 1.20 resistance to reach 1.19, highest levels since 2021
- Asian currencies rallied broadly: Singapore dollar to strongest since 2014, Malaysian ringgit to highest since 2018
- Currency options markets saw record volumes with hedging costs reaching Bloomberg data inception highs

The dollar's decline accelerated mid-week when Trump stated he could make the currency move "like a yo-yo" and wasn't concerned about weakness. However, Friday's Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination provided some support, with the dollar recovering 0.75% as markets repriced expectations for less accommodative monetary policy ahead.

**Fed Policy Transition and Warsh Nomination** 

Wednesday's Fed decision delivered a hawkish hold at 5.25-5.50% with two dissents from Waller and Mester favoring cuts, while Powell emphasized the economy's "firm footing" despite 2.75% inflation. The week concluded with Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, ending leadership speculation but introducing new policy uncertainty.

- Markets pushed first rate cut expectations from June to September following Warsh's nomination
- Only 1-2 cuts now priced for 2026, down from earlier dovish expectations
- Warsh's hawkish reputation and opposition to excessive QE during 2006-2011 tenure suggests reduced balance sheet accommodation
- Confirmation faces delays as Senator Tillis blocks all Fed nominees pending DOJ probe resolution
- Treasury curve steepened on reduced QE expectations: 2Y down 3bp to 3.54%, 30Y up 3bp to 4.90%

**Debasement Trade Reversal and Commodities Volatility**

The week witnessed both the culmination and dramatic reversal of the "debasement trade," with precious metals reaching historic peaks before suffering their worst declines in decades on the Warsh nomination.

- Gold surged through $5,500 to new records before crashing 8% Friday - worst decline since 1983
- Silver rocketed from $30 to $120 before plunging 29% Friday in worst drop since 1950
- Copper hit 16-year highs at $13,942 on 300K-800K ton supply shortage in 26M ton market
- Industrial metals complex pulled back Friday but maintained elevated levels on structural deficits
- Natural gas spiked 35% early week on Arctic weather before normalizing as weather premiums faded

The precious metals reversal reflected unwinding of speculative positioning as Warsh's hawkish credentials reduced concerns about currency debasement and excessive monetary accommodation.

**Technology Earnings Divergence and AI Infrastructure Spending**

Major technology earnings revealed stark differences in AI investment returns, with markets beginning to discriminate between beneficiaries of infrastructure spending and companies struggling to monetize AI investments.

- Meta surged 18% for the month on $135B capex guidance (87% increase) justified by record revenue beat
- Microsoft suffered historic selloff, falling 7% despite $38B capex increase as Azure growth disappointed
- Apple reported record $144B revenue but faced margin pressure warnings from "significant" memory chip cost increases
- Tesla announced $20B capex doubling to pivot toward AI/robotics while discontinuing Model S/X
- ASML delivered massive earnings beat with €13.2B bookings versus €6.85B expected, validating AI infrastructure demand

Memory chip shortages emerged as a critical constraint, with Samsung and SK Hynix reporting record earnings as DRAM prices gained 120% year-over-year and NAND rose 90%. The shift from broad AI optimism to winner selection drove historic single-stock volatility across the technology sector.

**Geopolitical Tensions and Market Resilience**

Multiple geopolitical flashpoints emerged throughout the week, yet equity markets demonstrated remarkable resilience in reaching fresh records despite mounting uncertainties.

- Iran tensions escalated with Trump's "speed and violence" military threat over nuclear negotiations
- Indonesia faced potential MSCI downgrade with $13B passive outflows at risk over free float requirements
- Government shutdown deadline Friday over Homeland Security funding disputes
- China military purge deepened with investigation of top general Zhang Youxia
- Trade tensions persisted with 25% tariff threats against South Korea

Despite these risks, the S&P 500 touched 7,000 for the first time while Asian markets showed strength, with the Hang Seng approaching 28,000 and Korean markets surpassing Germany to become the world's 10th largest by capitalization.

**Week Ahead**

- February employment data release Friday, with labor market resilience key to Fed policy outlook
- Indonesia MSCI decision timeline could trigger emerging market volatility
- Iran nuclear negotiations deadline approaches amid military positioning
- Q4 earnings season continues with focus on AI investment sustainability
- Government funding resolution needed to avoid DHS shutdown

The week's developments suggest markets are transitioning from broad reflation trades toward more selective positioning, with the Warsh nomination potentially marking an inflection point for both monetary policy expectations and currency dynamics. The dramatic precious metals reversal indicates speculative excesses may be unwinding even as underlying structural themes around AI infrastructure and supply constraints remain intact.
