Trump's explicit endorsement of dollar weakness and coordinated Fed-BOJ intervention drove the greenback to four-year lows this week, while Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair nomination triggered dramatic precious metals selloffs. Markets reached fresh records despite deteriorating breadth as AI earnings revealed a critical divergence between companies monetizing massive capex investments and those struggling to justify unprecedented spending levels.

**Dollar Debasement and Coordinated Intervention**

The week began with unprecedented coordination between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, marking the first joint currency intervention signals since 2002. This rare peacetime cooperation proved remarkably effective, strengthening the yen 2% within minutes on Monday and establishing credible intervention threats.

- USD/JPY plunged from 159 to 152 intraweek following coordinated rate checks
- Trump's Tuesday statement that he's "not concerned" about dollar weakness accelerated the decline
- DXY fell 1.3% Tuesday to reach four-year lows, with the move intensifying Wednesday
- EUR/USD broke through 1.20 resistance to touch 2021 highs near 1.22
- Asian currencies rallied broadly: Korean won gained 1.6%, Singapore dollar reached strongest levels since 2014

The intervention's effectiveness represented a potential inflection point for dollar policy, with markets interpreting coordinated action as an alternative to tariff escalation. However, Friday's Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair partially reversed these moves, with the dollar gaining 0.75% as debasement trades unwound.

**Precious Metals Volatility and Debasement Trades**

Gold and silver experienced both historic gains and dramatic reversals as markets grappled with Fed independence concerns and currency debasement fears.

- Gold breached $5,000 Monday, reaching $5,514 by Thursday before Friday's 8% collapse - the worst single-day decline since 1983
- Silver hit $120 midweek before plunging 29% Friday to $80, marking the worst drop since 1950
- The moves reflected massive speculative positioning built around Fed independence concerns
- Goldman Sachs maintained $5,400-$5,500 gold targets despite Friday's selloff

The extreme volatility highlighted how concentrated positioning in debasement trades had become, with Friday's Warsh nomination serving as a catalyst for widespread unwinding across precious metals markets.

**AI Infrastructure Divergence**

Tech earnings revealed a critical fault line in AI investing, with markets beginning to differentiate between companies showing clear revenue returns versus those burning capital without evident monetization paths.

- ASML delivered stunning results with Q4 bookings of €13.2 billion versus €6.85 billion expected, nearly doubling estimates
- Meta gained 8-10% Friday despite announcing $135 billion capex (87% increase) after Q1 revenue guidance crushed estimates
- Microsoft fell 6-10% as Azure growth of 38% disappointed against 66% capex increase to $38 billion
- Memory shortage intensified with DRAM prices up 120% year-over-year and NAND up 90%

Software stocks collapsed broadly on AI disruption fears, with SAP falling 13-14% and ServiceNow declining 7-8%. The divergence suggests markets are moving beyond blanket AI enthusiasm toward rigorous assessment of capital allocation efficiency and revenue generation capability.

**Federal Reserve Chair Succession**

Kevin Warsh's nomination Thursday as Fed Chair created modest market repricing, ending speculation about more dovish alternatives like BlackRock's Rick Rieder.

- Treasury curve steepened: 2-year yields fell 1bp while 30-year yields rose 3bp to 4.90%
- Rate cut expectations pushed further out, with first move now priced for September 2025
- Warsh's hawkish credentials include opposition to QE and preference for smaller balance sheets
- Confirmation faces delays as Senator Tillis blocks all Fed nominees pending DOJ investigation of Powell

The nomination partially explains Friday's precious metals collapse, as markets unwound positions built on concerns about Fed independence and potential money printing pressures.

**Hot Inflation and Economic Resilience**

Friday's PPI data reinforced concerns about persistent wholesale price pressures, supporting the case for fewer rate cuts despite Trump administration preferences.

- December PPI rose 0.5% monthly versus 0.2% consensus, with year-over-year acceleration to 3.0%
- Core PPI jumped 0.7% monthly, more than triple the 0.2% estimate
- Data suggests core PCE could reach 3.1%+, above Powell's 3.0% projection
- Q4 GDP tracking remains above 4% with unemployment stabilized

The inflation surprise occurred alongside continued economic strength, creating a challenging environment for the Fed's dual mandate and reducing scope for aggressive easing.

**Week Ahead**

Key developments to monitor include:

- Warsh confirmation hearings and potential timeline for Fed transition
- Memory chip earnings from Samsung and SK Hynix to test supply shortage narrative
- Iran nuclear deal deadline and potential military escalation
- Government shutdown risk as midnight Friday deadline approaches on DHS funding
- Indonesia MSCI decision that could trigger $13 billion in passive outflows

The week highlighted growing policy complexity as markets navigate dollar weakness preferences, Fed independence questions, and the maturing AI investment cycle. The dramatic precious metals reversals suggest speculative positioning around these themes may have reached extremes, though underlying policy uncertainties persist.
