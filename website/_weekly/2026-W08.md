**Weekly Macro Brief: February 16-22, 2026**

Markets navigated escalating geopolitical tensions and structural AI disruption concerns as Trump issued a military ultimatum to Iran while private credit stress emerged with Blue Owl's fund suspension. The week saw continued disconnect between robust US fundamentals and dovish Fed pricing, culminating in hawkish FOMC minutes that shocked consensus expectations.

**Geopolitical Escalation Dominates Risk Assets**

The Trump administration's Iran strategy evolved from diplomatic engagement to military ultimatum over the course of the week, creating the most significant geopolitical risk premium since the invasion of Ukraine.

- Iran-US nuclear talks began Tuesday in Geneva with initial flexibility signals, but collapsed by Friday when Trump issued a 10-15 day military action timeline
- The administration deployed the largest Middle East military buildup since the Iraq War, positioning two carrier strike groups in the region
- Brent crude surged from $68 to $72 per barrel by Friday, with analysts estimating a $5 geopolitical premium now embedded
- Gulf states including UAE and Saudi Arabia warned against using their territory for potential strikes, complicating military options
- Gold maintained elevation above $5,000 throughout the week on persistent safe-haven demand
- Defense stocks outperformed in Japan and Korea as regional allies prepared for potential spillover effects

**Fed Policy Disconnect and Hawkish Surprise**

Markets maintained dovish Fed expectations despite strong fundamentals, creating a fundamental disconnect that was partially resolved by Wednesday's surprisingly hawkish FOMC minutes.

- US economic conditions remained robust with GDP nowcast at 3.6% and core inflation at 2.5%, yet markets continued pricing three Fed cuts for 2025 at the week's start
- The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.03% on Tuesday as traders priced a potential third cut following benign January CPI data
- Wednesday's FOMC minutes shocked consensus by showing officials discussing potential rate hikes, with several citing AI productivity gains as justification for a higher neutral rate
- Fed's Daly noted AI productivity gains are "undeniable" but duration remains uncertain, signaling a structural shift in policy thinking
- A political dispute emerged between Minneapolis Fed's Kashkari and the White House over Fed independence after criticism of tariff research
- December PCE data due Friday was delayed by prior government shutdown, creating additional uncertainty around policy direction

**Private Credit Stress and Alternative Asset Contagion**

Blue Owl's suspension of withdrawals from a $1.5 billion retail private credit fund on Friday reignited transparency and liquidity concerns across the sector.

- The firm suspended withdrawals indefinitely from its OBDC2 fund while selling $1.4 billion in loans near par value despite marking them at a 75% NAV discount
- The development exposed potential duration vulnerabilities and liquidity mismatches in retail-accessible private credit vehicles
- Alternative asset managers including Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone fell over 6% on contagion fears
- Software sector exposure remains a particular concern given ongoing AI disruption fears across the $1.8 trillion private credit market
- Raymond James maintained Strong Buy ratings on diversified platforms, viewing the selloff as overdone

**AI Disruption Accelerates Sector Rotation**

The "SaaS apocalypse" narrative gained momentum as AI disruption moved from theoretical to measurable business impact, creating significant sector-specific volatility.

- Software sector declined 20% year-to-date on AI disruption fears, with Palo Alto Networks falling 7.5% Wednesday on weak guidance
- Real estate emerged as the best-performing S&P sector, viewed as immune to AI disruption
- ByteDance's Doubao upgrade and Seaweed 2.0 video model demonstrated commercial-quality capabilities, while Chinese AI video models including KlingAI reached monetization thresholds
- VIX remained subdued despite idiosyncratic moves, though RBC warned of structural volatility premium emerging for AI-disrupted names
- Memory bottleneck in AI infrastructure supported Korea's outperformance, with the market up 31% year-to-date versus less than 1% gains for MSCI China

**UK Data Supports Aggressive BOE Easing Path**

UK economic weakness intensified throughout the week, cementing expectations for aggressive Bank of England policy response.

- Unemployment rose to a 5-year high of 4.4% Tuesday, with negative job creation over the past year
- Youth unemployment (18-24 males) reached 17%, highlighting structural labor market weakness
- Wednesday's CPI fell to 3.0% from 3.4% prior, the lowest reading since March 2024, driven by declining fuel, airfare, and food costs
- Despite headline improvement, services inflation remained elevated at 4.3%, a key BOE concern
- Sterling fell below 1.36 on the weak data series, with April BOE cut now fully priced and 70%+ odds for March action

**Week Ahead**

Key developments to monitor include:

- Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff authority expected, potentially invalidating IEEPA provisions
- Iran military ultimatum timeline approaching mid-March, with oil markets pricing increasing risk premium
- December PCE and Q4 GDP data delayed from government shutdown, crucial for Fed policy path
