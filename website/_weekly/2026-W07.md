**Weekly Macro Brief: February 09-15, 2026**

Markets diverged sharply this week as Asian equities hit record highs while dollar weakness persisted despite stronger US labor data. Japan's historic election victory triggered policy repricing, China's Treasury guidance created bond market volatility, and AI disruption fears spread beyond traditional tech sectors into wealth management and professional services.

**Japan's Political Revolution and Policy Implications**

Prime Minister Takaichi's landslide election victory on Sunday delivered the LDP's largest mandate since WWII, triggering massive market repositioning and policy expectations.

- Nikkei surged 4% Monday to record highs, followed by another 2.8% gain Tuesday as reflation bets intensified
- USD/JPY unexpectedly strengthened to 156 despite pre-election yen weakness expectations, prompting MOF intervention warnings
- Markets repriced BOJ policy aggressively, now pricing 80% probability of April rate hike versus previous June base case
- Proposed sales tax suspension worth ¥5 trillion annually raises fiscal sustainability questions despite Finance Minister claims of no additional JGB issuance needed

The election outcome created immediate tensions between Takaichi's loose fiscal policy preferences and BOJ officials signaling current 0.75% rates may be "too accommodative." Real wage declines continue pressuring the central bank toward normalization despite political preferences for accommodation.

**Asian Equity Outperformance and Dollar Weakness Paradox**

Asian markets delivered their strongest year-to-date performance this century, outpacing the S&P 500 by 10 percentage points despite conflicting US economic signals.

- MSCI Asia-Pacific gained 13% year-to-date versus S&P 500's 1% - the widest 11-point gap since 2000
- Korean KOSPI hit fresh highs with Samsung and SK Hynix accounting for 51% of index gains on memory chip shortages
- Taiwan upgraded GDP forecasts to 8% from 4.5% on semiconductor demand before markets closed for Lunar New Year
- Dollar declined for five consecutive sessions through Thursday, defying stronger US payrolls data that doubled expectations at 130,000 jobs

The counterintuitive dollar weakness amid improving US data suggests ongoing positioning unwinds, with offshore yuan approaching the critical 6.90 handle despite PBOC pushback through daily fixing adjustments.

**China's Treasury Guidance and Policy Divergence**

Chinese regulators advised domestic banks Monday to reduce US Treasury holdings citing concentration risks, though the directive excluded sovereign wealth funds and created only temporary market volatility.

- 10-year Treasury yields initially spiked 4 basis points to 4.24% before stabilizing as impact proved limited
- China's bank Treasury holdings total $682 billion, down from $1.3 trillion a decade ago
- Chinese inflation data Wednesday disappointed with CPI at 0.2% versus 0.4% expected, extending PPI deflation to 40 consecutive months
- PBOC maintained accommodative stance, injecting 450 billion yuan Thursday ahead of Lunar New Year - larger than previous day's doubled amount
- China 10-year yields fell to record lows near 1.80% as deflationary pressures persisted despite stimulus

The policy divergence highlights China's domestic demand weakness even as global positioning favors yuan appreciation.

**Economic Data Whiplash and Fed Repricing**

Markets struggled to reconcile conflicting US economic signals as consumer spending stalled while labor markets showed resilience.

- December retail sales disappointed Wednesday with 0% growth and 8 of 13 categories declining month-over-month
- Thursday's payrolls doubled expectations at 130,000, pushing unemployment down to 4.3%
- Fed rate cut expectations shifted from June to July following jobs strength, though 2-3 cuts remain priced for 2026
- Markets continue flip-flopping between "bad news is good news" and genuine growth concerns

The data whiplash reflects underlying economic uncertainty as fiscal stimulus effects fade while labor markets maintain momentum.

**AI Disruption Spreads Beyond Traditional Tech**

Artificial intelligence disruption narratives expanded beyond software into wealth management and professional services, creating new sector rotation patterns.

- Charles Schwab fell 7.4% and Raymond James declined 8.8% Tuesday on Altruist's AI tax planning tool launch
- Software sector showed mixed performance with DataDog surging 14% despite continued disruption fears
- TSMC's 37% January sales surge validated AI infrastructure demand, with memory chip shortages creating 600% DRAM price increases
- Alphabet's record $20 billion bond issuance, including 100-year sterling notes, demonstrated strong credit appetite for AI capex financing
- Hyperscaler spending reached $650 billion annual run rate, up 60% year-over-year

Goldman Sachs CEO called the software selloff "overdone," though disruption risks appear to be spreading into previously insulated sectors.

**Week Ahead**

Key events and data releases for the coming week include:

- Munich Security Conference on Friday presents geopolitical risk around NATO and Ukraine discussions
- Taiwan markets remain closed through next week for Lunar New Year celebrations
- UK PM Starmer faces Gorton/Denton by-election in two weeks, with Greens favored and Labour distant third
- Indonesia's 70% nickel production cut creates structural supply deficit risk for battery makers
