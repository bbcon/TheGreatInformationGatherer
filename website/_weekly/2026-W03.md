Federal Reserve independence faced an unprecedented assault this week as the Trump administration's DOJ probe into Chair Powell triggered a coordinated defense from global central banks, while markets pivoted toward small caps and commodities amid shifting policy expectations and geopolitical tensions.

**Fed Independence Under Siege**

The week's dominant narrative centered on the Justice Department's criminal investigation into Fed Chair Powell over building renovation cost overruns, escalating into a full-blown institutional crisis. Powell's public accusation of "extortion" and "intimidation" marked an extraordinary breach of central bank decorum that reverberated globally.

- Global central banks issued an unprecedented joint statement defending Fed independence, including the ECB, Bank of England, and Reserve Bank of Australia
- Three former Fed chairs (Bernanke, Yellen, Greenspan) and multiple former Treasury Secretaries signed letters supporting Powell
- Republican Senator Tom Tillis threatened to block all Fed nominations until the probe is resolved, creating potential 12-10 committee deadlock
- Trump stated "no plans to fire" Powell but promised to name a replacement "within weeks," calling the current chair "lousy"
- Markets showed measured response despite the institutional gravity, with Treasury yields largely unchanged and rate cut expectations pushed to mid-2026
- JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon definitively ruled out accepting the Fed chair role, while Kevin Hassett emerged as the frontrunner according to betting markets

The crisis highlighted the contradiction in Trump's approach - seeking lower rates while undermining the institution responsible for delivering them. As Dimon noted, "anything that chips away at independence raises rates over time."

**Small Cap Revolution and Market Rotation**

Small caps delivered their most extraordinary outperformance in decades, extending their winning streak to 11 consecutive sessions by Friday - the longest such run since the late 1980s. The Russell 2000 gained 8% year-to-date versus the S&P 500's 2% advance, creating a 6-percentage-point differential that has occurred only five times since 1979.

- The rotation reflected rate-sensitive positioning rather than economic optimism, with investors betting on Fed cuts and fiscal stimulus
- Value stocks outpaced growth by 13% since November, with the cheapest quintile trading at 10th percentile valuations historically
- Large cap CAPE ratios approached 40 (near the all-time high of 44) while small caps traded at relative discounts
- Equal-weight sectors consistently outperformed cap-weighted indices throughout the week
- Transportation and mid-cap stocks also gained momentum on domestic economic exposure themes

The rotation occurred despite consumer sentiment sitting in the 10th percentile historically, creating a pattern that has served as a contrarian bullish signal in past cycles.

**Precious Metals and Commodity Explosion**

Commodities delivered spectacular gains as the "debasement trade" accelerated amid Fed independence concerns and geopolitical tensions. Silver surged past $90 per ounce to record highs while gold topped $4,600, driven by multiple structural and cyclical factors.

- Silver gained over 10% for the week, hitting fresh records above $94 before retreating to $90 levels
- Gold, copper, tin, and aluminum all reached new highs on supply constraints and AI infrastructure demand
- Central bank gold purchases increased foreign reserve allocations from 6% to 22% since 2020, providing structural support
- Physical silver scarcity in London emerged as US tariff hoarding created supply bottlenecks
- Oil initially rallied on Iran tensions before plunging 5% below $60 as Trump delayed military action

The metals rally reflected what traders termed a "commodity security theme" as US-China decoupling drove demand for critical materials, while Fed credibility concerns fueled debasement hedging.

**Banking Sector Earnings Disappointment**

Major banks delivered mixed results despite revenue beats, with investment banking misses and regulatory threats overshadowing strong underlying performance. The sector faced multiple headwinds from political interference and policy proposals.

- JP Morgan fell 4% despite record profit expectations, hurt by investment banking revenue declining 2% versus 19% growth estimates
- Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup all declined 3-4% on expense guidance concerns despite revenue beats
- Goldman Sachs posted record equities trading revenue of $4.3 billion, the highest in Wall Street history
- Trump's proposed 10% credit card interest rate cap threatened significant revenue cuts, with universal bank opposition
- The steepening yield curve environment supported net interest margin expansion, with JP Morgan guiding to $103 billion NII

Payment processors Visa and Mastercard fell on the credit card cap proposal, though they could benefit from increased debit transaction volumes as borrowers shift to alternative payment methods.

**Geopolitical Tensions and Policy Uncertainty**

Iran protests and Trump's secondary sanctions threats created oil market volatility before subsiding on de-escalation signals. Policy uncertainty extended beyond geopolitics into domestic regulatory proposals.

- Over 2,500 protesters reportedly killed in Iran demonstrations, with Trump threatening 25% tariffs on countries trading with Tehran
- Oil rallied to two-month highs above $64/barrel before plunging as Trump delayed military strikes
- China's record $1.2 trillion trade surplus showed resilience despite tariff pressures, with export growth doubling consensus expectations
- The Supreme Court delayed ruling on USTR tariff legality, disappointing apparel stocks
- Asian markets surged on record volume as capital rotated away from US assets amid political uncertainty

**Week Ahead**

Key catalysts include the Monday deadline for Trump's credit card rate cap decision, Wednesday's Supreme Court hearing on presidential power to fire Fed governors, and Friday's Bank of Japan rate decision. Taiwan Semiconductor's blowout $52-56 billion capex guidance validated AI infrastructure investment themes, suggesting continued semiconductor strength.

The week revealed fundamental tensions between Trump's goals of lower borrowing costs and his willingness to undermine the institutions capable of delivering them. While markets showed resilience, the combination of Fed independence erosion, policy uncertainty, and extreme positioning in small caps and commodities created multiple paths for volatility ahead.
