Markets endured a volatile week dominated by Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh's hawkish implications, historic precious metals liquidation, and mounting concerns over AI infrastructure spending returns. The S&P 500 fell from near-record highs to the 5,800s by Friday as tech capex panic spread, while gold and silver experienced their sharpest reversals in decades amid forced speculative unwinding.

**Fed Policy Recalibration Under Warsh**

Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed Chair fundamentally altered market expectations for monetary policy, triggering reassessments across asset classes throughout the week.

- Initial Monday reaction focused on Warsh's hawkish balance sheet stance, with precious metals immediately selling off 8-10%
- Tuesday's unexpected ISM Manufacturing expansion (first since 2022) reinforced reduced easing expectations, pushing 10-year yields toward 4.30%
- By week's end, BNP Paribas projected zero rate cuts in 2026, contrasting with market pricing of two cuts
- Warsh's historical opposition to QE and preference for "gradual and predictable" balance sheet reduction signaled major policy shifts ahead
- Morgan Stanley warned of increased bond volatility under less transparent Fed communications
- Friday's Treasury rally (10-year yields fell 7bp to 4.20%) reflected safe-haven demand as equity markets tumbled

**Historic Precious Metals Liquidation**

Gold and silver experienced their most violent selloff in decades, unwinding parabolic Q4 2025 gains through forced liquidation and margin calls.

- Gold crashed 8-10% on Monday alone, falling from $5,500 recent highs toward $2,840-$4,494 range
- Silver collapsed 13-40% over multiple sessions, briefly breaching critical $70 support that hadn't been tested since mid-December
- Ten-day volatility reached highest levels in decades for gold; silver volatility hit 45-year highs
- CME raised margins twice during the week, accelerating forced selling
- Chinese retail investors faced heavy losses with ETFs halted due to premiums and physical gold queues forming in Hong Kong
- Brief Wednesday recovery (gold +1.6%, silver +5%) proved unsustainable as selling resumed Thursday-Friday
- Gold/silver ratio normalized to ~60 from extreme sub-50 levels, suggesting structural rebalancing

**AI Capex Panic Spreads**

Technology earnings revealed unsustainable infrastructure spending levels, triggering broad selloffs across software and digital assets by week's end.

- Alphabet's initial 7% after-hours decline Thursday on $185 billion 2026 capex guidance (vs $120 billion consensus) set the tone
- Amazon compounded fears Friday with $200 billion AI spending plan, causing 11% after-hours plunge despite 24% AWS growth
- Combined hyperscaler capex of $650 billion raised fundamental questions about return timelines and monetization
- Software sector entered bear market territory, with IGV ETF down 30% from September highs
- Nine worst S&P performers year-to-date were SaaS companies, each declining 25%+
- Anthropic's legal documentation tool sparked existential fears about recurring revenue model sustainability
- Private credit firms suffered worst day since April 2025 on 20% software exposure concerns

**Crypto and Risk Asset Unwind**

Digital assets led broader risk-off sentiment as leveraged positions unwound violently, highlighting structural vulnerabilities in momentum strategies.

- Bitcoin crashed from $70,000 to below $63,000 Friday, falling 50% from October peak
- MicroStrategy reported $12.3 billion mark-to-market losses as treasury model came under pressure
- Perpetual futures funding rates turned negative for first time in months, signaling deleveraging
- Corporate bitcoin strategies trading below $76,000 cost basis, with shares down 28% weekly
- Silver's extreme volatility (highest since 1980) exemplified broader momentum unwind
- Memory stocks surged early week (SanDisk +15%) before tech selloff reversed gains

**International Divergence and Policy Shifts**

Global markets showed stark regional divergence as policy paths separated and trade relationships evolved.

- India-US trade deal (tariffs cut to 18% from 25-50%) drove rupee rally and equity surge, boosting MSCI Asia 2.8% Tuesday
- China PMI returned to contraction (49.3 manufacturing, 49.4 non-manufacturing), pressuring commodities
- Korean markets faced record $3.4 billion single-day foreign selling Friday, ending first weekly loss of 2026
- ECB held rates with Lagarde citing "balanced risks," while EUR/USD strength near 1.20 complicated export competitiveness
- Bank of England surprised with 5-4 dovish vote, endorsing 50/50 March cut probability
- Japan faced intervention concerns as yen weakened toward 157, with weekend elections adding uncertainty
- US-Iran diplomatic talks in Oman reduced military risk premium, pressuring oil below $70 Brent

**Week Ahead**

Key events will determine whether this week's volatility marks a healthy correction or the start of broader deleveraging:

- Amazon earnings reaction and any additional mega-cap guidance revisions
- Japan election results and potential yen intervention decisions
- Iran diplomatic talks outcome - failure could restore oil risk premium
- Silver's hold above $70 critical for precious metals complex stability
- Labor market data (delayed by government shutdown) for Fed policy implications
