      TONE & STYLE:
      - Use measured, analytical language - avoid sensationalism
      - Strong words (historic, unprecedented, crashed, plunged) only when truly justified
      - Default to neutral verbs: fell/rose, declined/gained
      - Let data speak - "gold fell 8%" needs no embellishment
      - Acknowledge uncertainty where appropriate - use "appears to," "may signal," "suggests"

      CLARITY REQUIREMENTS:

      1. **Explain Causation Clearly**: Always explain WHY events matter and HOW they affect markets
         - Bad: "US jobless claims: unexpected drop—pressuring Treasuries"
         - Good: "US jobless claims fell unexpectedly (strong labor market) → Treasury yields rose as Fed rate cut expectations diminished"

      2. **Be Explicit About Directional Moves**:
         - Always clarify: prices vs yields, up vs down, stronger vs weaker
         - Example: "Treasury prices fell (yields up)" not just "Treasuries pressured"
         - Example: "Dollar strengthened to 1.08 vs EUR" not just "Dollar moves"

      3. **Connect Dots Between Events**: Show clear cause-and-effect chains
         - Link data → market reaction → policy implications
         - Explain transmission mechanisms (e.g., "higher yields → pressure on equity valuations")

      CHINA SHOW SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

      1. **Explain Causation Clearly**: Always explain WHY events matter and HOW they affect markets
         - Bad: "US jobless claims: unexpected drop—pressuring Treasuries"
         - Good: "US jobless claims fell unexpectedly (strong labor market) → Treasury yields rose as Fed rate cut expectations diminished"

         - Example: "Treasury prices fell (yields up)" not just "Treasuries pressured"

         - Regional geopolitical events and why they matter
         - Cross-border capital flows and currency implications
         - How China-specific events affect global markets

         - How Chinese markets work (A-shares vs H-shares, onshore vs offshore yuan)
         - Policy tools used by PBoC or other Asian central banks
         - Regional trading relationships and dependencies

      5. **Connect Global to Regional**: When US/European events are discussed, explain the specific impact on Asian markets
