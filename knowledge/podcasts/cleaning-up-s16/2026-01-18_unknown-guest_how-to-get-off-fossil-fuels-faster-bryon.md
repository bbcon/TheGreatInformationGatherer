# How To Get Off Fossil Fuels Faster: The Pragmatic Climate Reset

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest Background:** Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance and prominent energy analyst, is interviewed by co-host Bryony Worthington about his two-part essay series "The Pragmatic Climate Reset" published in Bloomberg.

**Main Topics:** This episode focuses on Part Two of Liebreich's reset, which critiques how the climate and clean energy community approaches the energy transition. Part One (discussed in episode 220) challenged narratives that the energy transition has failed.

**Key Thesis:** While clean energy momentum is real and growing, the climate community needs to reset its approach across eight key areas: politics, targets, energy priorities, science, diplomacy, finance, hydrogen, and policy design. The transition will succeed not through demonization and expensive mandates, but through focusing on affordable solutions that naturally displace fossil fuels.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Political Reset: Stop Treating People Like "Hostages at a Cash Machine"

**Liebreich's Core Argument:** The climate movement has alienated ordinary people by appearing sanctimonious and imposing expensive solutions without considering their economic concerns. His provocative phrase "stop taking the knee to Greta Thunberg and start worrying about utility bills" encapsulates this.

**Worthington's Challenge:** She questions why Liebreich focuses criticism on climate activists like Greta rather than populist politicians like Trump who deny climate change entirely. She notes the asymmetry of calling out green activists while giving populists a pass.

**Liebreich's Response:** He explains he's more useful as an energy analyst than political commentator. **"Neither of us are going to persuade a single person who's set against clean energy... All we can do is deny them an audience"** by explaining to persuadable people why populist rhetoric is wrong on physics, economics, and environmental science. Railing against "bad guys" doesn't work—better analysis does.

**The Deeper Issue:** There's an anti-progress element in parts of the green movement that turns people off. Degrowth narratives are non-starters, especially for people in the Global South emerging from poverty, but also for G7 countries where many face economic strain.

### Energy System Priorities: Focus on the Affordable 90%

**The Framework:** Liebreich argues we should **focus on the first 90% of decarbonization that's affordable** rather than obsessing over the expensive final 10%. The UK's "Clean Power 2030" target (95% zero-carbon electricity) exemplifies the problem—pushing for purity in one sector while neglecting cheaper opportunities elsewhere.

**Key Insight:** UK electricity is already 60% clean, but heating and transport are nearly 100% fossil-fueled. **Electrifying these sectors would be cheaper than achieving the last increments of grid decarbonization**, even with resistive heating (though heat pumps are far better). The same applies to industrial electrification.

**The Missing Strategy:** The UK desperately needs an **electrification strategy** rather than just a clean power target. This would signal that hydrogen-for-homes schemes are dead and focus on near-term technologies with proven cost curves.

**Supporting Evidence:** The biggest barrier is that the UK has the **highest electricity costs in the G20**. Solutions include:
- Zonal pricing to break the link with natural gas prices
- Moving social charges and taxes into general taxation
- Recognizing that electrification itself drives down electricity prices by spreading fixed costs over more demand

### Climate Targets: The 1.5°C Problem

**The Core Issue:** The 1.5°C target from the Paris Agreement requires halving fossil fuel use by 2030—essentially **destroying 50% of global energy infrastructure in a few years**. Liebreich argues this was adopted without proper examination of costs or feasibility.

**Historical Context:** Going back to 2015 and the Paris Agreement, there was **remarkably little reflection on what 1.5°C would actually cost**. The 2018 IPCC report said 1.5°C is better than 2°C (which Liebreich agrees with) but required a **marginal carbon price of $6,050/ton versus $200/ton for 2°C**—yet no politicians examined this.

**The Reset Position:** We should acknowledge that 1.5°C has failed as a near-term target while maintaining that **developed countries still need to reach "net zero-ish" by 2050** to allow the whole world to get there by 2070 (consistent with 2°C). This is more honest and achievable than pretending 1.5°C is still alive.

**Political Implications:** The reverence for 1.5°C has created unrealistic expectations and opened the door for populist backlash when those expectations aren't met.

### Science Reset: The RCP 8.5 Problem

**The Issue:** Climate scientists took a shortcut by using **RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) as their "worst case scenario"**—but they created this scenario by massively inflating coal consumption to physically impossible levels rather than modeling genuine worst-case climate sensitivities.

**Why It Matters:** This approach has **serious political consequences** because critics can easily pick it apart, undermining the credibility of climate science. Worthington admits she was initially incredulous when Liebreich first told her about this issue.

**The Technical Problem:** RCP 8.5 requires reaching 1,200 ppm CO2 by 2100, which is impossible because:
- There isn't enough recoverable coal on the planet
- Tipping points don't impact fast enough to get there
- Yet most **tipping point research uses RCP 8.5**, making it like studying when milk boils over by putting it on maximum heat—it doesn't tell you what happens at realistic temperatures

**What Should Happen:** Scientists should separate emissions scenarios from climate sensitivity modeling. We need **whole-earth-system models** that include feedbacks like loss of reflectivity from reduced sulfur dioxide emissions (the "termination shock"), social feedbacks, and cascading risks—not just inflated energy system emissions.

**Liebreich's Analogy:** "I want to make myself a cup of cocoa... I want to know when it boils over and so I'm going to put it on RCP 8.5... Gas mark 10... Of course, it boils over, makes a horrible mess. The problem is that doesn't tell you what it would have done had you put it onto gas mark 5."

### Diplomacy Reset: Fixing the COP Process

**Current Problems:** The COP (Conference of Parties) process has become unwieldy, with tens of thousands of attendees and a consensus-based decision-making structure that allows any country to block progress. The focus on economy-wide targets has failed.

**Liebreich's Proposals:**
1. **Hold COPs on islands with no more than 5,000 beds** to dramatically reduce size
2. **Make decisions non-binding and majority-based** rather than requiring consensus
3. **Reduce meetings to one week**
4. **Focus on sectoral agreements** (steel, shipping, aviation, copper supply) rather than economy-wide targets
5. **Change who attends**: Get finance ministers, trade ministers, and industry ministers—people with real power—not just environment ministers who "can't pull the skin off a milk pudding domestically"
6. **Remove land use and agriculture** from UNFCCC entirely—these are too bound up with social policy and national identity

**Historical Context:** Liebreich admits he was wrong before—in 2011 he wrote "Yabasta" (enough already) calling for an end to COPs, then four years later the Paris Agreement proved him wrong. So he's not calling for disbanding the UNFCCC, just reining it in.

**Why Sectoral Approaches:** Environment ministers gathering annually can't crack the whip on agriculture or steel. You need the ministers who are "around the table when the big spending decisions are made."

### Finance Reset: From "Institutionally Fossilist" to Over-Correction

**The Historical Problem:** In 2013, Liebreich wrote about the financial system being **"institutionally fossilist"**—like institutional racism, no individual could be identified as the problem, yet the system systematically advantaged fossil fuels through banking rules (Basel 2), fiduciary duty restrictions, and other mechanisms.

**The Pendulum Swing:** The system swung too far the other way, attempting to **use financial regulation to tilt the playing field toward clean energy and choke off finance to fossil fuels**. This approach was fundamentally flawed.

**Why It Doesn't Work:**
- **You can't choke off finance to profitable businesses**—if capital becomes scarce, returns go up, attracting investors who "don't give a damn" about climate
- Coal's cost of capital did increase, but that's an exception
- The attempt created the entire **ESG edifice, which was "epistemologically unsuccessful"**—the idea that collecting enough data could reveal a company's true sustainability impact was "kind of ridiculous"

**The Meta-Critique of Politicians:** Liebreich argues there was a period when people forgot that **capital follows spreadsheets and returns driven by specific sectoral policies**. Politicians became too craven to regulate in the real economy, hoping financial wizardry could do their work for them: **"If you want buildings to be low-carbon buildings, if you want power stations to be low-carbon power stations, if you want cars to be low-carbon cars, then you've got to regulate in the real economy."**

**The China Exception:** Worthington raises Professor Ma Jun's episode showing China successfully aligned macroeconomic policy with clean energy goals. Liebreich suggests this was more about "joined-up policy" across sectors, and questions whether it was the macro levers or sectoral policies that mattered—suggesting this as a PhD thesis topic.

**What's Needed:** A **level playing field with transparency**—good HR policies, emissions data, etc.—but **stop demonizing politically unfavored sectors** that are currently keeping the lights on.

### The Demonization Debate: A Key Exchange

This exchange captures a central tension in the episode:

**Worthington:** "If we all need gas to keep homes warm, particularly for the poor and vulnerable, how dare we demonize the companies providing it?"

**Liebreich:** "You yourselves know they are capable of behaving like demons because they will present false solutions very merrily. We're going to do hydrogen homes..."

**Worthington:** "It was Shell pushing hydrogen harder than any other single fossil fuel company. You can demonize their behavior of promoting false solutions... But what you can't demonize is a whole sector in all its behavior in every department, including the bits that are providing fossil fuel to keep old people's homes warm."

**Resolution:** "Be judicious, surgical, be very clear about what we are going to demonize."

**The Deeper Point:** Companies aren't monolithic entities—they're collections of staff and shareholders (often pensioners). Penalizing "the company" ultimately penalizes ordinary people. The desire to penalize is "ugly and shouldn't be the motivator."

### Climate Justice and Energy Affordability

**The Controversial Sentence:** Liebreich wrote something like "if you care about climate justice, let the fossil industry keep prices low"—which Worthington challenges given that gas prices drove fuel poverty.

**Liebreich's Clarification:** Climate justice must **include energy affordability**. The model of putting a price on carbon that drives up fossil fuel costs, hoping clean energy eventually brings prices back down, means **"in that arc people will suffer terribly—the poor and the vulnerable, not the climate campaigners and the NGO... mainly middle class very vocal activist community."**

**The Core Principle:** **"We cannot have a transition which starves people of energy services. That's not what justice looks like."**

**The Alternative Approach:** Rather than using price signals to make fossil fuels expensive, **grow clean energy as fast as possible and let it push fossil fuels off the system**. If fossil prices drop temporarily, that's okay—decline rates (especially for fracked gas and oil at ~10% annually) mean it won't last long.

**Global Justice Dimensions:** Climate justice includes differential impacts on communities, disadvantaged groups breathing polluted air, job losses in poor communities, child labor issues, and countries with tiny carbon footprints that shouldn't make sacrifices. But it must also include not imposing energy poverty during the transition.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Four-Line Energy System Model

From Part One, Liebreich's simple model: **Grow clean energy as fast as possible → Clean energy pushes fossil fuels off the system → Don't focus on banning/pricing fossil fuels → Focus on making clean energy cheaper and more abundant**

**Application:** This reframes the transition from a battle against fossil fuels to a race to scale clean energy. It's more politically palatable and economically sound.

### The 90/10 Rule for Decarbonization

**Framework:** The first 90% of decarbonization in any sector is relatively affordable with existing or near-term technologies. The last 10% is expensive, uncertain, and at the bleeding edge.

**Application:** Prioritize policies and investments in the affordable 90%:
- **Do:** Electrify transport, heating, and industry with proven technologies
- **Don't:** Obsess over 100% clean electricity while ignoring fossil-dominated sectors
- **Be careful:** Technologies like hydrogen, CCS, and direct air capture that haven't shown cost curve improvements

### The Experience Curve Test

**Framework:** Some technologies get cheaper with volume and time (following experience curves), others don't.

**Examples that passed:**
- Solar PV
- Wind turbines  
- Batteries
- Electric vehicles (now with BYD producing "better cars" than Tesla at lower cost)

**Examples that haven't:**
- Hydrogen in most applications
- Carbon capture and storage
- Direct air capture
- Potentially electric ferries

**Application:** Policy mechanisms that simply demand greater volume over time only work for technologies on experience curves. For others, you need breakthrough innovation first, not just scale-up subsidies.

### The Sunset Clause Principle

**Framework:** Policies supporting expensive technologies should have **automatic review mechanisms** (if not full sunset clauses) that evaluate:
- Whether costs have come down as promised
- Whether the technology is approaching the $250/ton CO2 threshold
- Whether continued support is justified

**Application:** This protects against:
- Lobbying for pet projects
- Sunk cost fallacy in policymaking  
- Technologies that will never be cost-competitive
- Examples like EU's RED III and RFNBO regulations for biofuels

**Worthington's Counter:** Sunset clauses might increase cost of capital as investors price in political risk. Better approach: Use **adaptive regulation** (as in the UK Climate Change Act) that can be modified more easily than primary legislation, allowing course corrections without automatic termination.

### The Institutional Fossilism Concept

**Framework:** Like institutional racism, a system can produce biased outcomes even when no individual actor is intentionally biased. The financial system had multiple features that systematically advantaged fossil fuels.

**Application:** Understanding this helps explain why simply trying to tilt the system the other way (through ESG, climate finance mandates, etc.) doesn't work—you need to address the structural features, not just reverse the bias.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### "Stop Taking the Knee to Greta Thunberg"

**The Take:** The climate movement's reverence for youth activists and 1.5°C absolutism has become counterproductive. We should **refocus on ordinary people's utility bills** rather than symbolic gestures.

**Reasoning:** This isn't an attack on Greta specifically, but shorthand for refocusing on average people's concerns. The movement has become too disconnected from economic realities.

**Pushback:** Worthington notes this seems to punch left at activists while giving right-wing climate deniers a pass. Liebreich acknowledges this asymmetry but argues he's more useful doing energy analysis than political commentary.

### Financial Regulation Can't Solve Climate

**The Take:** The attempt to use **financial regulation, ESG frameworks, and climate finance mandates to drive the transition has failed**. Politicians hoped bankers would do their hard work for them.

**Reasoning:** Capital follows returns determined by real economy policies. **"Don't expect some poor banker working in New York to do your hard work for you. You've got to regulate in the real economy and do the hard yards."**

**Exception:** China may have succeeded with macroeconomic climate policy, but that's due to unique circumstances and joined-up policymaking, not replicable elsewhere.

### The 1.5°C Target Should Be Abandoned (Sort Of)

**The Take:** We should **stop pretending 1.5°C is achievable** while maintaining that developed countries need net-zero-ish by 2050 for a 2°C pathway.

**Reasoning:** The math of 1.5°C (halving fossil fuels by 2030) was never seriously examined for costs or feasibility. Maintaining the pretense undermines credibility and enables populist backlash.

**Nuance:** This isn't climate denial—2°C still requires urgent action. It's about **honesty and achievability** over aspirational targets that breed cynicism when missed.

### RCP 8.5 Has Damaged Climate Science Credibility

**The Take:** Climate scientists' reliance on an **unrealistic worst-case scenario has been a strategic mistake** that allows critics to dismiss climate research.

**Reasoning:** Creating a worst case by inflating coal use to impossible levels, rather than modeling genuine worst-case climate sensitivities, was intellectually dishonest and politically damaging.

**Implication:** The scientific community needs to **separate emissions scenarios from sensitivity modeling** and be more rigorous about realistic pathways.

### Don't Demonize Fossil Fuel Companies (Mostly)

**The Take:** While you can criticize fossil fuel companies for promoting false solutions (like hydrogen for homes), **you can't demonize the entire sector** for providing energy that keeps people warm.

**Reasoning:** 
- Companies are just collections of employees and shareholders (often pensioners)
- Penalizing companies penalizes ordinary people
- The "desire to penalize is ugly and shouldn't be the motivator"
- Be "judicious, surgical" about what specifically to criticize

**Worthington's Pushback:** You can't give them a clean bill of health either—need to be selective about what behaviors to call out.

### Carbon Pricing Should Be Modest, Not Aggressive

**The Take:** While a **social cost of carbon is appropriate**, excessive carbon pricing (like $500/ton policies) causes more harm than good.

**Reasoning:** High carbon prices hurt the poor and vulnerable during the transition arc, even if they theoretically drive clean energy adoption. Better to make clean energy cheaper than make fossil fuels more expensive.

**Example:** Canada's carbon fee-and-rebate system, despite being designed to be progressive, became politically toxic. Mark Carney's first move was signaling he was "on the side of the sensible center" by backing away from it.

### CFDs Are a Response to Poorly Structured Markets

**The Take:** **Contracts for Difference have been successful but spawn their own problems** (like curtailment) and exist because power markets lack proper long-term instruments.

**Reasoning:** If power markets had liquidity in 15-year terms and proper derivatives, private innovation could replace government-dominated CFD markets.

**Counter-argument:** The existence of CFDs may actually suck liquidity from properly constructed markets, preventing their development.

**Worthington's Defense:** The Low Carbon Contracts Company successfully de-risked capital into offshore wind, and when wind is curtailed, CFDs don't pay, so we're not paying for curtailment through them.

## 5. Practical Implications

### For UK Policy

**Immediate Needs:**
1. **Develop an electrification strategy** (or separate strategies for heat, transport, and industry) to signal focus on proven, affordable technologies
2. **Lower electricity prices** through:
   - Zonal pricing to break the gas price link
   - Moving social charges and green levies into general taxation
   - Recognizing that more electrification spreads fixed costs and lowers prices
3. **Deprioritize "Clean Power 2030"** purity in favor of electrifying heating, transport, and industry
4. **Allow experimentation with cheaper EVs** (Chinese vehicles) to test whether affordable electrification is possible

**What Won't Happen:** Government won't suddenly rename Clean Power 2030 to "CP 2040" and delay auction rounds, but an electrification strategy could emerge.

### For International Climate Diplomacy

**COP Reform Proposals:**
1. Drastically reduce size (5,000 bed limit)
2. Shift to majority voting, non-binding decisions
3. Reduce to one-week meetings
4. Focus on sectoral agreements (steel, shipping, aviation, copper)
5. Invite finance, trade, and industry ministers instead of just environment ministers
6. Remove agriculture and land use from UNFCCC scope

**Sectoral Focus Areas:**
- Steel industry decarbonization
- Shipping and aviation pathways
- Copper supply for electrification
- Technology transfer mechanisms

### For Financial Institutions

**What to Do:**
- Maintain **level playing field** with transparency on emissions and ESG factors
- Focus on **real economy policies** that change investment returns, not financial engineering
- Provide good HR policies and data without trying to be climate policymakers

**What to Stop:**
- Attempting to choke off finance to fossil fuels (it just raises returns and attracts different capital)
- Over-reliance on ESG ratings and climate finance mandates
- Pretending financial regulation can substitute for real economy regulation

### For Technology and Investment Decisions

**The $250/ton Test:**
All clean energy policies should demonstrate a pathway to **under $250/ton CO2 abatement cost**. Technologies that can't show this pathway should:
- Have sunset clauses or review mechanisms
- Focus on R&D rather than deployment subsidies
- Wait for breakthroughs before large-scale support

**Priority Technologies (Proven Cost Curves):**
- Solar PV
- Wind (onshore and offshore)
- Batteries
- Heat pumps
- Electric vehicles
- Grid-scale storage

**Caution Zone (Unproven Cost Curves):**
- Hydrogen for heating
- Most hydrogen applications
- Carbon capture and storage
- Direct air capture
- Some maritime applications (electric ferries)

### For Climate Communicators

**Messaging Shifts:**
1. **Lead with benefits** (efficiency, cost savings, air quality) not sacrifice
2. **Focus on the physics** of the "electrification revolution" rather than temperature targets
3. **Acknowledge trade-offs** honestly rather than pretending everything is win-win
4. **Stop sanctimonious messaging** that alienates ordinary people worried about bills
5. **Be surgical in criticism**—call out specific bad behaviors (like hydrogen-for-homes promotion) rather than demonizing entire sectors

**What to Avoid:**
- Treating people like "hostages at a cash machine"
- Reverence for unachievable targets
- Anti-progress, degrowth narratives
- Vindictiveness toward fossil fuel companies and their workers/shareholders

### For Understanding Market Dynamics

**Key Insight:** The transition will succeed through **clean energy abundance**, not fossil fuel scarcity. This means:

- **Don't obsess over** banning fossil fuels or making them expensive
- **Do focus on** making clean energy cheaper and more abundant
- **Understand that** if fossil fuel prices temporarily drop as clean energy scales, that's okay—decline rates will catch up
- **Recognize that** the first 90% of decarbonization is affordable; don't let the expensive 10% slow down the easy stuff

**Investment Implications:**
- Technologies on experience curves will continue getting cheaper
- Policy support for expensive solutions may not persist (sunset risk)
- Electrification infrastructure is the safe bet
- Hydrogen, CCS, and other expensive solutions face higher policy risk

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On Political Strategy:**
> "Neither of us are going to persuade a single person who's set against clean energy... All we can do is deny them an audience. All we can do is to explain to those people who might be sort of susceptible to their rhetoric that in fact it is misguided."

**On Financial Regulation:**
> "If you want buildings to be low-carbon buildings, if you want power stations to be low-carbon power stations, if you want cars to be low-carbon cars, then you've got to regulate in the real economy. Don't expect some poor banker working in New York to do your hard work for you."

**On Climate Justice:**
> "We cannot have a transition which starves people of energy services. That's not what justice looks like."

**On Demonization:**
> "You can demonize their behavior of promoting false solutions... But what you can't demonize is a whole sector in all its behavior in every department, including the bits that are providing fossil fuel to keep old people's homes warm. You can't demonize that."

**On the RCP 8.5 Problem:**
> "I want to make myself a cup of cocoa... I want to know when it boils over and so I'm going to put it on RCP 8.5... Gas mark 10... Of course, it boils over, makes a horrible mess. The problem is that doesn't tell you what it would have done had you put it onto gas mark 5."

**On the Transition Strategy:**
> "Grow clean energy as fast as possible and let the clean energy push the fossil off the system... We should have different targets, different priorities within the energy system."

## Final Reflections

**Liebreich's Self-Critique:** He expresses disappointment that the piece wasn't provocative enough—too many people agreed with it. He acknowledges two potential weaknesses:

1. **Political concession risk:** Pedro Fresco (Spanish renewable energy association head) argued that admitting we need a "reset" concedes the field to opponents

2. **Implementation gap:** The piece doesn't adequately address how leaders actually reset their rhetoric, stakeholder relationships, and organizational commitments without loss of face—"How does a bank that espoused a 1.5 degree target now move to a two-degree target?"

**Worthington's Alternative Framing:** Rather than obsessing about targets and percentages, focus on **"the physics of the electrification revolution"**—it's more efficient, lighter, less energy-intensive, and brings tangible benefits.

**The Meta-Point:** This conversation exemplifies the tension between pragmatic, technocratic approaches to the energy transition and the political/activist approaches. Both hosts largely agree on the substance while disagreeing on emphasis and framing—suggesting the "sensible center" on climate action may be broader than political polarization suggests.

**The Unwritten Book:** Throughout the conversation, both participants note that a full book would be needed to address all the nuances—including critiques of degrowth advocates, detailed responses to populist climate denial, and practical guides for organizational change. The essays are provocations meant to start conversations, not comprehensive solutions.
