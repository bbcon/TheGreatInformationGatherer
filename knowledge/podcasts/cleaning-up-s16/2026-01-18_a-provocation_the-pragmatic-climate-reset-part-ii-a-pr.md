# The Pragmatic Climate Reset, Part II: A Provocation

## 1. Episode Overview

**Host:** Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg NEF and host of Cleaning Up Podcast

**Context:** This is Part II of Liebreich's "Pragmatic Climate Reset" - a comprehensive reframing of climate strategy following Donald Trump's re-election. Part I debunked narratives claiming the energy transition has failed by exposing flawed analysis from commentators like Dan Yergin, Michael Cembalest, and Tony Blair.

**Key Thesis:** The climate and clean energy community faces a choice: remain reactive and watch progress slow, or undertake a "pragmatic climate reset" - winding back historical overreach, accepting harsh realities, addressing legitimate concerns, and finding new ways to communicate with a confused public. This isn't a manifesto but a provocation intended to spark critical conversation across eight areas: politics, targets, energy priorities, hydrogen, science, diplomacy, finance, and regulation.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### **Climate Politics: Winning Back the Sensible Center**

**The Problem:** Liebreich argues the climate community bears significant blame for political polarization - not just oil companies and think tanks. The approach has alienated the "sensible center" where most hardworking, asset-owning people reside.

**What Must Stop:**
- Talking down to people and making them feel guilty
- Using implausible scenarios to scare people
- Disrupting commutes and using anti-Nazi terminology to demonize opponents
- Treating taxpayers and consumers "like hostages at a cash machine"

**Key Insight:** When someone says climate change is natural, or we can't do anything, or it costs too much - they're not ignorant. They're expressing legitimate fears that the current approach will increase living costs, expand state power, empower unelected elites, and still fail to solve the problem. "Hand on heart, can you say those fears are unfounded?"

**The New Framework:** Focus on three principles:
- **Self-interest:** Families can prosper in a low-carbon world (not crony capitalism)
- **Fairness:** Injustices are being reduced and risks averted (not climate lawfare)
- **Harmony:** The places and cultures we love will endure (not environmental fundamentalism)

**Bottom line:** "Stop taking the knee to Greta Thunberg and start worrying about energy bills."

### **Climate Targets: Putting 1.5°C Behind Us**

**Historical Context:** In June 2015, G7 leaders introduced the concept of "decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century" - the political enthronement of net zero. The Paris Agreement promised to hold warming "well below 2°C" but included language to "pursue efforts" to limit it to 1.5°C to secure support from small island states.

**The 1.5°C Problem:** The IPCC's SR15 report (October 2018) showed that keeping to 1.5°C would require:
- 45% emissions cuts from 2010 baseline by 2030 (50% from 2018 levels)
- Net zero by 2050
- Carbon prices potentially reaching **$6,050 per ton** (versus $225/ton for 2°C)

**Critical Analysis:** Liebreich argues this target was adopted in "an orgy of virtue signaling" ahead of COP26 without considering costs. Energy assets have 30+ year lifetimes - cutting emissions by half in 12 years meant writing off trillions in productive assets, costs not captured in IPCC analysis.

**The Irony:** "The world went mad for 1.5 degrees at almost exactly the moment it became clear it could not be achieved." Liebreich publicly stated 1.5°C was unachievable as early as 2018.

**The Reset:** Switch to a hard 2°C target with "net zero-ish" rather than absolute net zero:
- Advanced economies: 2050 target
- China: 2060 target  
- India: 2070 target
- If countries get within 5-10% of targets, "that will be pretty good going"
- Course-correct along the way using "adaptive pathways" with technologies and wealth generated over coming decades

**Rationale:** "It's not that 1.5 degrees of warming won't have devastating impacts... But that doesn't make it a credible target. Continuing to adhere to it leads to terrible policy decisions and undermines public support."

### **Energy System Decarbonization: Focus on the First 90%**

**Core Strategy:** "Switch to clean electricity and electrify almost everything" - this is at the heart of all low-carbon pathways ever modeled.

**What Can Be Electrified (at modest or no cost):**
- Land transport
- Domestic and commercial heating
- Low to mid-temperature industrial heat
- Thermal processes that can switch to electrochemistry
- High-temperature industrial heat (with modest carbon price)

**The Electricity Revolution - Evidence:**

*Coal's Decline:*
- US: 39% of power (2014) → 15% (2024)
- EU: 26% → 10%
- UK: 42% (2012) → 0% (closed final plant 2024)
- China: 73% (2014) → under 60% (Q1 2025)

*Wind/Solar Growth:*
- Grown by factor of **18x** over past decade
- Now meet nearly 20% of global power demand
- "Fastest growing new source of electricity in history by a wide margin"

*Manufacturing Capacity:*
- Solar: 2 terawatts/year panel manufacturing capacity (enough to replace 10% of fossil power)
- Batteries: 1 terawatt-hour manufactured last year (26x growth over decade)
- 1 TWh = enough to meet global power needs for half an hour
- Models show ~4 hours storage sufficient for most grids to handle daily variations

**Cost Trajectory:** After brief inflation spike, solar and wind cost declines have resumed. Costs now below new-built coal/gas practically everywhere, often below running existing plants.

**The 90% Solution:** Research by Trieu Mai (US NREL, 2022) showed decarbonizing nearly 90% of US grid would cost only **$125/ton CO2**. Only after that does it get expensive (reaching $1,000+/ton to get to 100%). Similar results found for UK, Germany, Australia.

### **Gas as Transition Fuel: A Nuanced View**

**Previous Position:** Liebreich "used to reject outright the idea of gas as a transition fuel."

**The Pragmatic Reset:** Distinguishes between two approaches:

*Bad approach:* Replace inflexible coal with inflexible gas plants → locked in for asset lifetime

*Good approach:* Replace inflexible coal with **flexible gas plants** → as long as regulation makes owners indifferent to hours of operation, no lock-in occurs

**The Pathway:**
- Start with flexible gas meeting 25% of grid output
- Continue adding cheap wind, solar, batteries, nuclear
- Push down gas usage until grid is 90%+ decarbonized
- Modeling shows many grids could continue below 5% flexible gas generation

**Additional Benefits:**
- Grid stability services even when not generating power
- Gas engines/turbines can be decoupled from generators - spinning but neither consuming nor generating
- Provides inertia, reactive power, short-circuit current, black-start capability
- Can ride through longer emergencies or renewable outages

**The Spain Example:** April 28, 2025 power cut was NOT caused by renewables (which were meeting 64% of demand). Problem was:
- Grid codes hadn't kept up with changing power mix
- Culture of non-compliance by market participants
- Weak interconnection to France
- Issue was voltage oscillations, not renewable penetration

**The Last 10% Question:** Getting to 100% decarbonized grid would require vast investment and high maintenance costs. But "this is simply not a question we need to answer today." By then we may be wealthy enough to afford it, or we may choose carbon removal, helping laggard regions, or other priorities like defense or adaptation.

### **The Hydrogen Reset: Deflating the Hype**

**The Disconnect:** "In all my decades as an analyst, I have never seen such a big disconnect between the physics and economics of what a solution can deliver and the politics of what is being asked of it."

**Why Hydrogen Hype is Dangerous:** If you wanted to delay the transition, you'd promote a solution that sounds perfect but doesn't work - ubiquitous, easy to make, produces only water when burned, will get cheaper, provides jobs, solves every problem. "It takes years and years for it to become clear that it is unaffordable, particularly if you can get the public to ignore 50 years of wasted public funds."

**Reality Check - Official Findings:**
- **EU Court of Auditors (2024):** Targets in EU's 2020 hydrogen strategy were "driven by political will rather than being based on robust analyses" - called for "reality check"
- **France's Cour des Comptes (Jan 2025):** Estimated hydrogen strategy implies carbon cost of at least €520/ton, "jeopardizes France's national finances"
- **Bloomberg (July 2024):** Chronicled "The $147 billion green hydrogen bubble that BP helped burst" in Australia

**The Cost Problem - No Pathway to Affordability:**

Green hydrogen production costs breakdown:
- 10% electrolyzer stacks (will see learning rates)
- 40% electricity
- 40% heavy engineering (electrical, chemical, civil)
- Plus: compression, transport, distribution, usage, safety management

**Key Insight:** While electrolyzer stacks will exhibit learning rates like solar PV, they're only 10% of cost. The other 90% (electricity and heavy engineering) won't plummet 3-10x as required. "You also have to add the cost of compression, transport, distribution, usage, and safety management."

**Sector-by-Sector Verdict:**

*Green Ammonia:* Perhaps viable only where:
- Dispatchable green power is very cheap
- Natural gas is very expensive  
- Local market for fertilizer exists
- Even then, current projects only proceed due to state mandates (China) or stacked subsidies (India)
- "The numbers simply don't add up, not even for Saudi Arabia's Neom mega project"

*Green Steel:* "Simply not urgent"
- Switch to natural gas direct reduction: 75% of climate benefit at fraction of hydrogen cost
- Keep working on direct electrical reduction and bio-coking coal
- These promise to be cheaper and more flexible than hydrogen

*E-fuels:* "Simply no way they will ever be cheap enough to replace petrol or diesel or compete with electrification"
- "You can't gather the products of combustion and reassemble them into a fuel at anything within a country mile of the original cost"
- "You can't make something from electricity which is cheaper than electricity"
- Germany needs to stop "technology openness" charade before witnessing "implosion of its entire automotive industry"

*Hydrogen Aviation:* "A dead parrot. Even Airbus seems to have understood."
- Plane would carry half the passengers (full of hydrogen and insulation)
- No plausible way to get liquid hydrogen to major airports at required scale

*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF):* Made from hydrogen with captured carbon
- Currently costs **12x more** than jet fuel (EU figures)
- Blending 1% drives up fuel cost by 12%, flight costs by 4%
- "Achieving almost nothing for the climate"
- No plausible pathway to order of magnitude cost reduction

*Blending into Gas Grid:* "The stupidest idea from Stupidville"
- Making chemical feedstock for €6-10/kilo, instantly reducing it to heat value of <€2/kilo
- Driving up costs to all other gas users
- Cannot get beyond 6% decarbonization without whole new pipeline network
- "Frankly, it beggars belief that blending is being supported by governments. It is quite simply a gross failure of public policy."

*Geological/White Hydrogen:* "Interesting field for scientific research" but:
- Probably can't be extracted at meaningful flow rate
- Unless high purity, it's just slightly lower carbon natural gas
- If resource won't last 40 years, can't build pipeline
- If won't last 20 years, can't build local fertilizer plant
- "Wishful thinking about geological hydrogen is not an energy strategy"

**What We Actually Need:** Decarbonize 100 million tons of current hydrogen demand (causing 2.3% of global emissions). But green hydrogen would cost at least $2/kilo more than fossil hydrogen:
- $200 billion/year additional cost (equivalent to entire global aid budget)
- Need 15-year offtake agreements for project finance
- Looking for **$3 trillion** of upfront bankable support
- "Three orders of magnitude more than any public money available today"

**The Only Affordable Solution:** Hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS):
- Must limit fugitive methane to <0.2%
- Must achieve 95%+ carbon capture
- Society needs to demand producers meet these targets instead of believing activist claims they're "physically unachievable"

**The Silver Lining:** Failure of green hydrogen will be good for the planet. Every kWh used to make hydrogen could deliver **2 to n times** the emissions reductions if used directly, at fraction of capital investment and maintenance cost.

### **Climate Diplomacy: Reforming the COP Process**

**Historical Context:** In 2011, Liebreich wrote "Ya Basta - Time to Call Time on the COP Show" arguing 17 successive COP failures were harming clean energy. After Paris Agreement (2015), he admitted: "In retrospect, I'm very glad no one listened to me."

**Today's Position:** "I'm not going to call for the UNFCCC or even the COP process to be abandoned. But climate diplomacy most certainly needs a pragmatic reset."

**The COP Circus - A Timeline:**
- **COP14 (Poznan, 2008):** 9,000 delegates, subcommittee debating position of a comma (still at it a year later)
- **COP15 (Copenhagen, 2009):** 27,000 delegates, freezing weather, poor food, huge lines, "produced nothing of measurable benefit to the climate"
- **COP21 (Paris, 2015):** 30,000 delegates, side events everywhere
- **COP26 (Glasgow, 2021):** 38,000 delegates, undisclosed proportion caught COVID, second breakthrough COP in history
- **COP28 (Dubai, 2023):** 84,000 delegates - "the UNFCCC's Woodstock" - spent week in taxis checking phones to see if world would "pretend to phase out unabated fossil fuels or only pretend to transition away from them"
- **COP29 (Baku, 2024):** Shadow of Trump's re-election, leaders promised $300 billion/year to developing countries by 2035

**The Rich/Poor Country Problem:** Classification is "stuck in the last century"

*"Rich" countries:* Full of people suffering economic hardship, stagnant incomes, cost of living crisis, persistent inflation, low growth, ongoing European war

*"Poor" countries:* Have skyscrapers, space programs, global multinationals, oligarchs owning European football clubs, middle classes taking international holidays, millions of kids at Western universities

**Critical Assessment:** "Astonishingly tin-eared for G7 leaders to fly off to Baku and promise to invest hundreds of billions of dollars per year in their emerging economic rivals, receiving nothing but a handful of climate indulgences in return."

**What Would Actually Help:** "The single best thing that developed countries can do to ensure the decarbonization of South Africa, Indonesia or wherever would be to succeed in decarbonizing their own economies while preserving their own population's standard of living. Do that and the whole world will follow."

**Reform Proposals:**

1. **Limit attendance:** Hold annual meeting on island with max 5,000 hotel rooms; broader meeting only every 5 years

2. **Change leadership:** Demand delegations led by ministers of finance, energy, or trade - NOT environment or climate ministers

3. **Accept reality:** Stop pretending plenary decisions are binding (no UNFCCC decisions are truly binding)

4. **Voting reform:** Move from consensus to qualified majority voting (would shorten meetings from two weeks to one)

5. **Sectoral focus:** Focus on sectoral deals in industry, energy, transport rather than economy-wide agreements

6. **Separate land use:** Move LULUCF (land use, land change, and forestry) into its own convention - "social, cultural, and political importance of land means no government will ever let the tail of climate negotiations wag the dog of national priorities"

7. **Shut down loss and damage:** Makes no sense to build duplicate aid infrastructure when losses cannot be unambiguously linked to climate change - "climate models which cannot predict individual storms, floods, fires, or droughts cannot be used retroactively to quantify the contribution of climate to their cause"

**The Game Theory:** Nearly 20 years ago, Liebreich explained climate change is not a simple prisoner's dilemma but a "repeated multiplayer game." Winning strategy (per Robert Axelrod's "Evolution of Cooperation"): be "nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear."

**UNFCCC's Role:** Act as coach and mediator, creating platforms for sectoral, bilateral and multilateral negotiations - NOT trying to deliver "global economic government by means of emissions policy."

### **Science Reform: Retiring RCP8.5**

**The Problem:** In 2018, Liebreich launched hashtag #RCP85isBollocks to draw attention to implausibility of worst-case emissions scenario used throughout climate research.

**Scientific Validation:** Two years later, climate scientists Zeke Hausfather and Glenn Peters published "Emissions: the 'business as usual' story is misleading" in Nature, agreeing RCP8.5 needed retirement.

**Current Status:** "RCP8.5 and its modern analog SSP5-8.5 remains the most popular scenario in the climate literature even today. This is a scandalous failure of science to self-correct."

**Why It Matters:** Creates "trivially easy attack surface for opponents of climate action." Trump's "Restoring Gold Standard Science" presidential order specifically named RCP8.5, citing 2017 academic research showing reaching it would involve burning more coal than exists in world's recoverable reserves. "On this matter, though it pains me to say it, President Trump is right."

**The Endangerment Finding:** Trump administration's "Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions" by five known climate skeptics intended to revoke EPA's endangerment finding. Liebreich's nuanced take:
- Much to criticize about the report
- BUT original endangerment finding based on pre-2009 science using scenarios even more extreme than RCP8.5
- "No one truly committed to science-based decision-making should object to a review in the light of another 15 years worth of additional research and data"
- Focus should be on ensuring objectivity (in which case endangerment finding would likely remain) rather than "rejecting a review out of hand"

**IPCC's Next Move:** About to sign off on new scenarios for AR7 (due 2029). Despite stipulating scenarios must be "plausible," IPCC imposes no peer-reviewed test of plausibility. "The worst case scenario which they're about to endorse is no more plausible today than RCP8.5 was 7 years ago."

**The Verdict:** "This suggests the failure to self-correct is not accidental, but intentional."

**Reform Requirements:**
- IPCC scenarios must be plausible from energy systems perspective
- Focus on actual landing zone: between 1.8°C (still "well below 2°C") and 3.5°C (plausible worst case)
- Note: Energy Secretary Chris Wright says 3.5°C would be "fine and dandy" based on William Nordhaus modeling that won Nobel Prize

**Core Principle:** "Scientists need to stop trying to scare people and they need to focus on informing them. Let society do the rest."

### **Sustainable Finance: The ESG Collapse**

**The Grand Ambition:** At COP26 Glasgow, 60 multilateral organizations promoted using finance to bend global economy toward net zero. Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) members managed **$130 trillion** in assets.

**The Verdict:** "It didn't work."

**The Unraveling:**
- Threats of legal action led to withdrawal of major names
- Severe pruning of organizations and initiatives
- Late 2024: Republican states launched antitrust lawsuits against leading asset managers
- US DOJ and FTC joined, claiming ESG used to drive up energy prices to boost investment returns
- Even in "regulation-loving Europe," tide turned against ESG

**EU's Retreat:** After complaints from France, Germany and others about excessive bureaucracy:
- EU taxonomy for sustainable activities proved to be "considerable overreach" (as Liebreich warned in 2021)
- Attempts to get asset managers to report scope 3 emissions were "simply a mess"
- European Commission and European Banking Authority forced to hack back reporting requirements

**The Fundamental Problem:** "While it may be possible to identify the life cycle carbon emissions of a single product or project, when it comes to a company or investment portfolio, it is simply impossible."

**Case Study - Bloomberg NEF:** How would investors have rated the emissions impact of initial £1 million raised in January 2006?
- Using grid power (mostly coal and gas)
- Flying to conferences and client meetings
- "Not good"
- BUT over next 20 years, became most trusted information provider to investors pouring trillions into climate solutions
- "That first million pounds may have been the single most effective climate investment in history"
- "Yet not one of today's ESG methodologies would have given it a pass mark"

**Back to Basics:**

*Companies:* Not vehicles for delivering social outcomes or justice - they produce products/services valued by customers. Must respect law, generate returns for investors, treat stakeholders fairly. "No evidence that becoming a so-called B-Corp improves behavior."

*Asset Managers:* Allocate capital into well-run businesses, provide custodianship, treat stakeholders fairly. Investment regulation needs to align with those goals and "stop trying to save the world."

*Policymakers:* Stop using financial system to discriminate against politically unpopular sectors. "If they want different outcomes, they need to regulate the real economy."

*Activists:* "Stop claiming oil and gas companies cause emissions, especially if you yourself haven't yet switched to green power, electric heating, and no-fly holidays. We are all the cause of emissions, and we all have to be the solution."

**Retire ESG:** Beyond basic fairness (delivered through strong leadership, healthy culture, robust HR), ESG is about nothing more than **risk and opportunity**. Every board needs to understand issues that could destroy their business or present opportunities. "The fact that some of them may stem from environmental, social, or governance factors doesn't justify a different department."

**Action Items:**
- Fire the consultants and box-tickers
- Reassign the corporate sustainability officer
- Focus on issues, not process

**Central Banks:** Their role is to maintain sound money and dynamic, flexible economy. "That's it. It is not their role to ensure the country meets environmental, social, industrial or other targets. That is the role of government."

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### **The 3% Solution (From Part I)**

**Framework:** If clean energy grows just 3% faster each year than total demand for energy services and maintains this for decades, fossil fuels will be "inexorably eventually squeezed out of the system."

**Application:** Demonstrates that transition success doesn't require dramatic immediate cuts in fossil fuel use - steady, persistent growth in clean energy is sufficient. "Transitioning like a tortoise" rather than "like a hare."

### **The 90/10 Rule for Decarbonization**

**Framework:** Focus on decarbonizing the first 90% as quickly and affordably as possible rather than letting perfect be the enemy of good.

**Mechanism:** Research shows:
- First 90% of grid decarbonization: ~$125/ton CO2
- Last 10%: $1,000+/ton CO2
- Similar pattern across geographies

**Application:** Prioritize rapid deployment of cost-effective solutions. Questions about the last 10% "are simply not questions we need to answer today" - by then we'll have more wealth, better technology, and clearer priorities.

### **The Plausible Pathway Test**

**Framework:** Any climate solution receiving public funding must demonstrate a plausible pathway to **$250/ton CO2 or less within a decade**, peer-reviewed and published.

**Three Tiers:**
1. **Already competitive** (with carbon price): Remove barriers, not more funding
2. **Pathway to $250/ton in decade:** May deserve funding or regulatory support
3. **Cannot meet test:** R&D or pilots only, not scale-up or rollout

**Application:** Provides objective filter for policy decisions, prevents waste on solutions with no path to affordability (like green hydrogen in most applications).

### **The Asset Lifecycle Approach**

**Framework:** Focus support mechanisms on the point when assets reach end of life and need replacement anyway.

**Key Insight:** "Huge cost difference between replacing a fully functioning boiler, car, power plant, or piece of industrial equipment and one that is fully depreciated."

**Corollary:** "If no one were ever again to purchase a fossil burning asset, the world would be on track to net zero in one asset cycle."

**Application:** Timing interventions to natural replacement cycles dramatically reduces costs and stranded assets while maintaining same long-term trajectory.

### **The Self-Interest, Fairness, Harmony Framework**

**Framework:** Win back the sensible center by focusing on:

1. **Self-interest:** Knowledge that families can prosper in low-carbon world (not crony climate capitalism)
2. **Fairness:** Sense that injustices are being reduced, risks averted (not climate lawfare)  
3. **Harmony:** Feeling that places we love, society and cultures will endure (not environmental fundamentalism)

**Application:** Reframe climate action around these values rather than guilt, fear, or moral superiority. Addresses real concerns about cost of living, state expansion, and elite power.

### **The Repeated Multiplayer Game**

**Framework:** Climate change is not a simple prisoner's dilemma but a repeated multiplayer game (per Robert Axelrod).

**Winning Strategy:** Be "nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear"

**Application:** UNFCCC should act as coach and mediator for sectoral/bilateral/multilateral negotiations, not attempt global economic government. Focus on creating platforms for cooperation rather than binding top-down mandates.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### **1. Gas as Transition Fuel (With Conditions)**

**Contrarian Element:** Liebreich "used to reject outright the idea of gas as a transition fuel" but now takes nuanced position.

**The Take:** Flexible gas plants (not inflexible ones) can enable deeper decarbonization by providing stability services while being squeezed out by growing renewables. Could help grids reach 90-95% decarbonization affordably.

**Reasoning:** Modeling shows many grids could continue below 5% flexible gas generation. Provides grid stability, handles longer emergencies, and creates option value for society to decide later whether to spend vast sums on last 10% or prioritize other needs.

**Pushback Expected:** From both sides - fossil fuel opponents who see any gas as lock-in, and gas industry who wants inflexible baseload plants.

### **2. The 1.5°C Target Must Be Abandoned**

**Contrarian Element:** Directly challenges what "serves as an article of faith for the climate community."

**The Take:** Switch back to hard 2°C target with "net zero-ish" (within 5-10% of targets counts as success).

**Reasoning:** 
- 1.5°C already passed or will be in next few years
- Pursuing it led to carbon prices of $6,050/ton vs $225/ton for 2°C
- Required premature retirement of half of existing energy assets
- "Shouldn't be at all surprising that so many people now associate climate action with profligate waste of public money"
- Continuing adherence "leads to terrible policy decisions and undermines public support"

**Evidence:** Liebreich publicly stated 1.5°C was unachievable as early as 2018 - "the world went mad for 1.5 degrees at almost exactly the moment it became clear it could not be achieved."

### **3. Green Hydrogen Has No Path to Affordability**

**Contrarian Element:** Challenges massive government and industry investment in hydrogen economy.

**The Take:** "Green hydrogen will play at most a tiny bit part in a future low-carbon energy system" - only affordable solution for current hydrogen demand is natural gas with CCS.

**Reasoning:**
- Electrolyzer stacks (which will see learning rates) are only 10% of cost
- Electricity (40%) and heavy engineering (40%) won't plummet 3-10x as required
- Every application has cheaper alternative (electrification, biofuels, efficiency)
- Blending into gas grid is "the stupidest idea from Stupidville"

**Supporting Evidence:**
- EU Court of Auditors: targets "driven by political will rather than robust analyses"
- France's Cour des Comptes: implies €520/ton carbon cost, "jeopardizes national finances"
- Bloomberg: "$147 billion green hydrogen bubble that BP helped burst"

**The Danger:** "If you wanted to delay the transition, you would promote a solution that sounds perfect but doesn't work... It takes years and years for it to become clear that it is unaffordable."

### **4. ESG Should Be Retired**

**Contrarian Element:** Calls for abandoning framework that has dominated sustainable finance for past decade.

**The Take:** "It's time to retire the term ESG" - beyond basic fairness, it's just risk and opportunity, doesn't justify separate department.

**Reasoning:**
- Impossible to calculate lifecycle emissions for companies or portfolios
- Bloomberg NEF example: initial investment looked terrible on ESG metrics but may have been "single most effective climate investment in history"
- Descended into box-ticking exercise
- Companies are not vehicles for delivering social outcomes
- Central banks' role is sound money and dynamic economy, not meeting environmental targets

**Action Items:** Fire consultants and box-tickers, reassign sustainability officers, focus on issues not process.

### **5. The Endangerment Finding Should Be Reviewed**

**Contrarian Element:** Agrees with Trump administration that EPA's endangerment finding deserves review (though not necessarily revocation).

**The Take:** "No one truly committed to science-based decision-making should object to a review in the light of another 15 years worth of additional research and data."

**Reasoning:**
- Original finding based on pre-2009 science using scenarios even more extreme than RCP8.5
- Focus should be on ensuring objectivity rather than rejecting review out of hand
- Claiming exercise is "entirely and completely without merit" undermines scientific credibility

**Expected Outcome:** Objective review would likely keep endangerment finding in place, but process matters for scientific legitimacy.

### **6. RCP8.5 Failure Shows Intentional Scientific Misconduct**

**Contrarian Element:** Accuses climate science community of intentional failure to self-correct.

**The Take:** Despite Hausfather and Peters' 2020 Nature paper agreeing RCP8.5 should be retired, it "remains the most popular scenario in the climate literature even today. This is a scandalous failure of science to self-correct... the failure to self-correct is not accidental, but intentional."

**Reasoning:**
- Creates easy attack surface for climate opponents
- Trump's executive order specifically cited RCP8.5, noting it requires burning more coal than exists in recoverable reserves - "on this matter, though it pains me to say it, President Trump is right"
- IPCC about to endorse new worst-case scenario for AR7 that is "no more plausible today than RCP8.5 was 7 years ago"
- Despite requiring scenarios be "plausible," IPCC imposes no peer-reviewed test of plausibility

**Implication:** Scientists prioritizing scary scenarios over credible ones, undermining public trust.

### **7. Climate Community Bears Blame for Polarization**

**Contrarian Element:** Holds climate advocates responsible for political backlash, not just fossil fuel industry.

**The Take:** "The reality is that the climate and clean energy community bears its own share of the blame for this situation."

**Specific Failures:**
- Talking down to people, making them feel guilty
- Using implausible scenarios to scare them
- Disrupting commutes
- Using anti-Nazi terminology to demonize opponents
- Treating taxpayers "like hostages at a cash machine"

**Key Insight:** When people express skepticism, they're not "ignorant and inattentive" - they're expressing legitimate fears about costs, state expansion, elite power, and likelihood of failure. "Hand on heart, can you say those fears are unfounded?"

### **8. Loss and Damage Should Be Shut Down**

**Contrarian Element:** Calls for ending major COP negotiating track that developing countries fought hard to establish.

**The Take:** "Shut down the loss and damage track. It makes no sense to build a duplicate aid infrastructure, particularly when losses cannot be unambiguously linked to climate change."

**Reasoning:** "Climate models which cannot predict individual storms, floods, fires, or droughts cannot be used retroactively to quantify the contribution of climate to their cause, no matter how many activist scientists tell you they can."

**Implication:** Current approach is scientifically unsound and creates parallel aid system that duplicates existing infrastructure.

## 5. Practical Implications

### **For Policy and Regulation**

**Value for Money Test:**
- All new climate grants, subsidies, regulations must pass cost per ton CO2 avoided test
- Must include contribution of overlapping measures (make multiple subsidies explicit)
- Repeat at 5-year intervals
- Solutions already competitive (with carbon price): focus on removing barriers, not more funding
- Solutions not yet competitive: must show plausible pathway to ≤$250/ton within decade (peer-reviewed, published)
- Solutions failing pathway test: R&D or pilots only, no scale-up funding

**Sunset Clauses:**
