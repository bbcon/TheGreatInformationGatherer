# Will Trump Derail California's Climate Ambitions? | Ep234: Liane Randolph

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest Background:** Liane Randolph recently stepped down as chair of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) after being appointed in 2020 by Governor Gavin Newsom. She previously served six years on the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). A lawyer by trade, Randolph spent 14 years in California state government, including roles at the California Natural Resources Agency. Her parents were both public servants—her father in the military, her mother a public school teacher.

**Main Topics:** The conversation explores California's ambitious climate policies, particularly its legally binding target to reach net zero by 2045, and how the Trump administration's aggressive rollback of climate policies is threatening the state's progress. The discussion covers transportation electrification mandates, California's cap-and-trade system, electricity market transformation, and the political challenges of maintaining climate ambition amid affordability concerns.

**Key Thesis:** California has successfully used regulatory innovation to drive clean technology markets, but faces unprecedented federal opposition that could derail progress while simultaneously dealing with rising costs from climate adaptation, inflation, and tariffs.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Federal Assault on California's Authority

**The Question:** How is the Trump administration threatening California's special status to set stricter-than-federal environmental regulations?

**Randolph's Perspective:** The current Trump administration is "more effective" at dismantling climate policy than the previous one. She describes them as **"just running around smashing things"** rather than simply creating policy drag. The administration has taken the unprecedented step of using the **Congressional Review Act—for the first time in U.S. history—to repeal state-level rules**.

**Key Mechanisms:**
- Every California rule must receive an EPA waiver to proceed
- Trump administration repealed waivers for the Advanced Clean Cars rule (100% EV sales by 2035)
- Repealed Advanced Clean Trucks rule (adopted in 2020, already being complied with)
- Repealed the "omnibus rule" for combustion engine standards on medium and heavy-duty vehicles

**Practical Impact:** CARB has initiated emergency rulemaking allowing companies to certify to either the new standards or older, less ambitious ones. All repeals are currently in court. The uncertainty creates **conformity problems** for new transportation projects under the Clean Air Act—if California can't show compliance with air quality standards, new infrastructure projects may be blocked.

### California's Electricity Transformation

**The Question:** How did California achieve periods of 100% clean electricity and what policies drove this transformation?

**Key Policy Mechanisms:**

1. **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS):** Required utilities to purchase defined amounts of renewable energy
2. **SB 350 (2018):** Established **Integrated Resources Planning (IRP)** process focused on GHG reduction targets, not just renewable percentages. This forced utilities to take a holistic view—if they shut down nuclear and replaced it with gas, that would negate renewable additions.
3. **Battery Storage Mandate:** Legislature directed the PUC to set storage targets when batteries were nascent and expensive

**The Duck Curve Solution:** California's famous "duck curve"—the sharp rise in solar generation during midday followed by steep evening demand—was addressed through the IRP process. The modeling looks at **8,760 hours per year** to determine what resources are needed at each hour, considering cost, reliability, and GHG targets.

**Results:** California now has approximately **10 GW of battery storage**. The combination of declining battery costs and increasing value (due to the duck curve and retiring gas plants) made storage economically attractive.

**Contrarian Insight:** Randolph notes the UK's market-led approach left conflicts between pricing, security, and environment unresolved for years, while California's **public regulator actively modeling and planning** proved more effective at driving transformation.

### The Tesla Origin Story

**Historical Context:** California's zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate began in 1990, requiring increasing percentages of EV production. The program faced industry pushback—GM famously recalled and scrapped its EV1 vehicles—leading to a period where measures were watered down.

**The Innovation:** CARB created a **tradeable credit system**—if an automaker couldn't meet ZEV requirements, they could buy credits from manufacturers with excess compliance. This was a CARB innovation that introduced market mechanisms into mandates.

**Tesla's Breakthrough:** Two engineers (Tesla's founders) recognized they could **sell regulatory credits to finance their high-end electric roadster**. Since Tesla made no combustion vehicles, every EV generated sellable credits. This regulatory structure was fundamental to Tesla's early business model and "revolutionized the industry."

**Broader Impact:** Tesla's success drove charging infrastructure development, battery efficiency improvements, and changed consumer perception of EVs as desirable rather than compromises.

### Cap-and-Trade (Now "Cap-and-Invest")

**Structure:** California's **whole-economy cap-and-trade system** covers:
- Industrial facilities and power plants (stationary sources)
- Refineries (both their emissions and the fuel they produce)
- Fuel sales (capturing transportation and heating)

**Key Features:**
- Declining emissions cap over time
- Companies can buy or sell allowances
- **Floor price of $25-26** per ton (can go higher, not lower)
- Mix of free allowances (varies by industry) and auctioned allowances
- Up to 4% (now 6%) of compliance can be met through **approved offsets**

**Offset Protocols:** California maintains strict standards—only "compliance offsets" following approved protocols are allowed. **Forestry is by far the largest**. Interestingly, there's a rice cultivation methane protocol that's barely used, despite California being a significant rice producer and exporter to Asia.

**Revenue Uses:** Auction proceeds fund:
- High-speed rail project
- Vehicle incentives
- Community-based mobility projects
- Bike and car sharing programs
- Charging infrastructure planning grants
- Sustainable transportation initiatives

### The Affordability Challenge

**The Problem:** California faces a "perfect storm":
- **Adaptation costs:** Utilities must underground infrastructure or harden poles against wildfire risk
- **Inflation:** Driven partly by gas prices, partly by tariffs
- **High electricity prices:** Making it harder to incentivize electrification
- **Capital investment needs:** Electrification requires higher upfront costs despite long-term savings

**Contributing Factors:**
- Wildfire mitigation requirements following catastrophic fires
- Tariffs increasing costs for equipment utilities need
- Fossil fuel subsidies making it "hard to compete"
- Very low fossil fuel prices in America compared to Europe

**Potential Solutions Discussed:**

1. **Increase electrification to spread fixed costs:** More electrons sold = lower per-unit costs
2. **Shift costs from ratepayers to general fund:** Use cap-and-invest or general revenues for policy programs rather than putting everything on utility bills
3. **Continue despite higher upfront costs:** Even with current rate structures, EVs are cheaper to operate if you can charge at home
4. **Make more affordable EVs available:** The market lacks the super-affordable Chinese EVs available in UK/Europe

**Randolph's View:** Despite higher upfront costs, **operating an EV is already more cost-effective than combustion vehicles** in California. Renewable diesel is frequently cheaper than fossil diesel for heavy-duty vehicles. The challenge is maintaining this advantage while managing the transition.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Regulatory Feasibility Framework

CARB must demonstrate that regulations are **feasible**—there's a viable path to compliance. This creates a careful balance: push technology forward without going so far ahead that industry can credibly claim impossibility.

**Application:** When setting ZEV mandates, CARB started with very small percentages and increased over time, allowing technology and markets to develop. When opponents claimed infeasibility (as with the EV1 era), the program was vulnerable to rollback.

### The Cascade Effect in Clean Technology

**Concept:** Technological advances in one sector enable breakthroughs in adjacent sectors through shared supply chains and learning curves.

**Examples Given:**
- Batteries: Laptop computers → EVs → Grid storage
- Biofuels: As transport electrifies, ethanol freed up can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel or marine fuel
- Aviation: Short-haul hybrid-electric planes (like Heart Aerospace's 800-mile range aircraft) can eventually scale to larger aircraft

**Application:** Policy should identify and accelerate these cascades rather than trying to solve every sector simultaneously.

### The "Look Around the Corner" Principle

Randolph argues that while focusing on "easy wins" makes sense, **some investment in future technologies is necessary because development takes time**. The Biden administration's approach of funding "proofs of concept" and "first of a kind demonstrations" plants seeds for future breakthroughs.

**Tension:** This conflicts with the "pragmatic reset" view (influenced by Michael Liebreich) that California should focus exclusively on cost-effective solutions and avoid expensive experiments like direct air capture or hydrogen when affordability is already challenged.

**Randolph's Position:** There's a middle ground—not doing "every single thing on the list" but maintaining "some amount" of forward-looking investment.

### The Scoping Plan Process

Every five years, CARB produces a **scoping plan** that:
- Models pathways to meet climate targets
- Examines multiple scenarios (typically four)
- Identifies where new technology will be needed
- Informs regulatory priorities

**2022 Scoping Plan Insights:**
- Modeled scenarios with carbon neutrality by 2030 vs. 2045
- Tested different sectoral priorities and investment strategies
- Concluded that **carbon capture will likely be necessary** for hard-to-decarbonize sectors like cement
- Identified potential for natural and working lands to become carbon sinks long-term

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Public Planning Beats Pure Markets for Energy Transition

Randolph's description of California's approach—with regulators actively modeling 8,760 hours per year, setting targets, and directing investment—contrasts sharply with market-led approaches. She notes the UK "left it all to the market" for years, creating unresolved conflicts between pricing, security, and environment.

**Reasoning:** Energy transition requires coordinating multiple objectives (cost, reliability, emissions) across long time horizons. Markets alone won't optimize for all three simultaneously, especially when fossil fuels are heavily subsidized.

### High-Speed Rail Deserves Continued Support

Despite widespread criticism of California's high-speed rail project for delays and cost overruns, Randolph defends it:

**Her Arguments:**
- A private Las Vegas-LA high-speed rail project "just announced significant cost and time overruns"—it's not just public projects
- Visible progress in Central Valley: overpasses, tracks being laid
- **"You have to get them started and they have to get that momentum"**
- Already bringing "significant jobs" to an economically disadvantaged region
- Cleaner than everyone driving I-5

**Counterpoint Acknowledged:** Host suggests California should "go with the grain" of what it's good at—aviation innovation—rather than rail, given America's aerospace strengths and potential for hybrid-electric regional aircraft.

### Cement Needs Carbon Capture, Not Just Alternative Materials

While acknowledging potential for alternative cement production using different aggregates, Randolph argues **direct air capture and carbon capture on cement facilities is necessary** because:

**Reasoning:**
- Transforming the cement industry to eliminate limestone takes "a long time"
- Incumbent producers are essentially "limestone quarriers" with land banks they won't write off
- California needs cement for roads and buildings between now and 2045
- Better to pilot carbon capture on cement in California (where it can't be used for enhanced oil recovery) than let it only be deployed on fossil facilities in other states

**Host's Pushback:** This only adds costs to a commodity product with no efficiency gains, unlike EVs which follow an improving cost curve.

### The Trump Administration Is Worse Than Expected

Randolph distinguishes between Trump's first and second terms: **"This one I would say is more effective at it."** The first administration repealed waivers but California could fight in court and maintain momentum through agreements with automakers. 

**This time:** Using the Congressional Review Act to repeal state rules is unprecedented and more difficult to counter. The administration is **"not even sort of having the kind of policy drags...they're like actively destroying things."**

## 5. Practical Implications

### For California's Climate Targets

**2030 Target (40% below 1990 levels):**
- California has met all targets to date, "blowing through" the 2020 target six years early
- **"There is a scenario under which we would be able to meet the 2030 target"**
- However, **"implementation is definitely at risk"** due to federal actions
- Energy sector has achieved significant reductions and continues strong progress
- Transportation sector progress now threatened by waiver repeals

**2045 Net Zero Target:**
- Modeling shows carbon capture will likely be necessary
- Natural and working lands currently carbon emitters but potential to become sinks
- Success depends on maintaining policy momentum despite federal opposition

### For Other States and Jurisdictions

**The California Model Elements:**
1. **Integrated planning:** Don't separate renewable targets from overall GHG goals
2. **Technology-neutral mandates:** Specify outcomes (storage capacity, zero emissions) not technologies
3. **Tradeable compliance mechanisms:** Allow market flexibility within mandates
4. **Progressive tightening:** Start with achievable targets, increase over time as technology improves
5. **Multiple policy tools:** Combine mandates, trading systems, and incentives

**Replicability Challenges:**
- Requires strong legal authority (California's Clean Air Act waiver is unique)
- Needs sustained political will across administrations
- Benefits from scale—California is world's 5th largest economy
- Geography matters (solar potential, space for renewables)

### For Industry and Investors

**Certainty Despite Federal Opposition:**
- California's targets are state law—federal government can't repeal them
- Even with waiver disputes, CARB is maintaining compliance pathways
- **Long-term direction remains clear** even if timeline has uncertainty

**Emerging Opportunities:**
- **Battery storage:** Continued growth as duck curve intensifies
- **Affordable EVs:** Market gap for lower-cost vehicles (Chinese EVs blocked by tariffs)
- **Sustainable aviation fuel:** As transport electrifies, biofuels can shift to aviation
- **Hybrid-electric aircraft:** California's aerospace strengths + electrification
- **Grid infrastructure:** Massive investment needed for distribution, transmission, wildfire hardening
- **Carbon capture on cement:** Pilot projects likely despite costs
- **Agricultural methane reduction:** Underutilized offset opportunity

**Risk Factors:**
- Tariffs increasing equipment costs
- Federal enforcement threats on Clean Air Act compliance
- Conformity issues blocking transportation projects
- Political backlash if affordability crisis worsens

### For Understanding Macro Trends

**The Subsidy Asymmetry:**
Randolph notes **"fossil fuel is so subsidized that it's hard to compete."** This includes:
- Very low gasoline prices in US vs. Europe
- Cheap natural gas from neighboring states
- No carbon pricing on fossil fuels outside cap-and-trade covered entities

**Implication:** Even successful clean technology deployment faces uphill battle against incumbent subsidies. True cost competitiveness requires either removing fossil subsidies or maintaining clean energy support.

**The Adaptation Cost Burden:**
Climate impacts are already forcing expensive adaptation (wildfire hardening, undergrounding infrastructure) **at the same time** as mitigation investments are needed. This creates a **"perfect storm"** for affordability that will intensify globally.

**The Federal Leverage Point:**
Host observes: **"If the US leans in, the world starts to take things more seriously and if the US decides to do the exact opposite and smash things then it's very effective at that too."** 

Example: International Maritime Organization was making progress on shipping emissions until US intervention. This demonstrates how US federal policy creates global ripple effects beyond its borders.

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On the Trump administration's approach:**
> "If you think about this administration and climate, they are just running around smashing things. They're not even sort of having the kind of sort of policy drags that we have seen in the past where it's like, oh well, we're not going to make any progress. No, no, no. They're like actively destroying things."

**On the importance of long-term investment:**
> "One of the things that was I think beneficial about the Biden administration's climate policy was that they were recognizing that looking around the corner takes time and so we do want to have at least some investment in what is around the corner."

**On California's track record:**
> "We started with an initial target in 2020 which we blew through you know six years early."

**On the challenge of competing with fossil fuels:**
> "The fossil fuel is so subsidized that it's hard to compete."

**On starting transformational projects:**
> "In order to bring projects like that to life, you have to get them started and they have to get that momentum."

---

**Final Takeaway:** California has successfully used regulatory innovation to create markets for clean technologies, particularly in electricity and transportation. However, the state now faces a unprecedented federal assault on its authority, rising costs from climate adaptation and tariffs, and political pressure around affordability—all while trying to maintain the most ambitious climate targets in the developed world. The tension between doing "easy" cost-effective measures versus investing in future technologies for hard-to-decarbonize sectors remains unresolved, but Randolph argues some balance is necessary even in constrained times.
