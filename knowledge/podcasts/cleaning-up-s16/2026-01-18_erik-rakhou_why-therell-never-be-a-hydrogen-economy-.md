# Why There'll Never Be A Hydrogen Economy: A Debate

## 1. Episode Overview

This episode features a spirited debate between **Michael Liebreich** (founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, hydrogen skeptic) and **Erik Rakhou** (BCG consultant, hydrogen proponent, author of "Touching Hydrogen Future"), moderated by Andrew Critow of S&P Global Commodities Insights.

**Main Topic**: Whether hydrogen will play a major role in the energy transition, or if it's an expensive distraction from more effective decarbonization pathways.

**Key Thesis Divide**: 
- **Liebreich argues**: Hydrogen faces insurmountable physics-driven cost problems that make it uneconomical for most proposed uses. We should focus on electrification instead.
- **Rakhou argues**: Hydrogen provides essential optionality and energy security, particularly for the "top two layers" of the hydrogen ladder (hard-to-abate industrial uses), and costs will decline with sustained investment.

The debate originated from Liebreich's controversial 2022 keynote criticizing the hydrogen economy, where Rakhou was chairing. Three years later, they remain cordial but fundamentally opposed.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Fundamental Cost Problem

**Liebreich's Core Argument**: Hydrogen has a **physics-driven cost problem** that learning curves cannot solve. Unlike solar panels or batteries (which are mass-manufactured products), hydrogen production is essentially a **chemicals plant** where:
- Only ~10% of costs come from the electrolyzer stack (which will follow solar-like learning curves)
- ~40% is heavy engineering (civil works, substations, compressors, heat exchangers, blast walls) with shallow learning curves
- ~40% is electricity costs (which already went down their learning curve)

**Key insight**: "What doesn't get you in the wash gets you in the rinse" - if you use cheap solar at €35/MWh, it only runs 8 hours/day, so you need **3x the capital equipment** to produce the same annual hydrogen volume, or add expensive battery storage.

**Current European hydrogen costs**: €6-13/kg vs. fossil hydrogen at ~€1/kg equivalent. Even optimistic projections of €4-5/kg remain **4-5x more expensive** than alternatives.

**Rakhou's Counter**: Points to lower costs in specific regions:
- Iberia and Nordics: €4/kg today
- China: $4/kg currently, targeting $2.25/kg by 2030
- India: $4/kg
- Australia: $5/kg moving toward $3-4/kg

He argues these projects are "in the money" when matched with appropriate use cases and that continued investment will drive costs down through learning curves.

### The Resilience/Energy Security Argument

**Rakhou's Position**: Hydrogen provides **energy security and resilience** - even if not used regularly, having the capability caps gas prices and reduces geopolitical vulnerability. Europe's dependence on energy imports makes this valuable.

**Liebreich's Devastating Counter**: The resilience argument fails on basic economics:
- During the Ukraine crisis, TTF gas prices spiked to ~€10/kg hydrogen equivalent for **one month**
- To justify building €5/kg hydrogen capacity as a hedge, you'd need gas prices to stay at that spike level for **14-15 years** (the project finance payback period)
- You can't build the capacity fast enough to use during a crisis - it takes 15 years to finance and construct
- **"You'd be much better off just buying the gas for the equivalent of €5 for the month and saying 'ouch'"**

The math: Europe uses 7 million tons of hydrogen annually. A €4/kg cost premium × 7 billion kg × 15 years = **over €400 billion in subsidies needed** just for existing hydrogen use, before adding steel, aviation fuel, trucks, or storage.

### The Aviation Fuel (eSAF) Debate

**Rakhou's claim**: eSAF (synthetic aviation fuel made from green hydrogen and captured CO2) projects are selling at $600/ton, "three times the price of oil."

**Liebreich's correction**: EU figures show eSAF is actually **12 times more expensive** than conventional jet fuel. The EU's 1% blending mandate by 2030 means:
- 1% of fuel costing 12x more = **12% fuel cost inflation**
- This translates to ~**4% increase in total flight costs**
- This is a hidden drag on the European economy
- The equivalent carbon price required: **$250/ton** (far above current €40-50 carbon prices)

**Key quote**: "No one's flying business class on that."

### The Transportation Question

**Moderator's framing**: Fossil fuels succeeded because they excel at humanity's three essentials - transportation, heating, and cooking. Battery electric vehicles are genuinely disrupting transportation because they're **better on almost every measure** (lower running costs, no servicing, better technology). Where's hydrogen's equivalent advantage?

**Liebreich's position**: 
- He runs **Pragma Charge**, delivering electric HGVs **cheaper than diesel today without subsidies** (in some European markets/routes)
- Hydrogen trucks, hydrogen cars (Toyota Mirai), even the flagship "Hype" hydrogen taxi service in Paris - all have failed or are failing
- His book is full of "Jules Verne style stories" about hydrogen cars that haven't materialized

**Rakhou's concession**: Agrees hydrogen won't dominate transportation - "Will there be millions of hydrogen cars? I have to agree that part... I'm not seeing it in the next 10 years."

### The "Just Keep Investing" Argument

**Rakhou's concern**: Liebreich's skepticism is **"causing a bit of a stop of people investing"** in developing hydrogen technology, preventing the cost reductions needed by 2050. He points to his hydrogen stock portfolio (50 stocks, up 13% year-to-date) as evidence of continued viability.

**Liebreich's response**: 
- He's a "learning curve dude" who calculated learning curves for industries from rock quarrying to printed circuit boards
- The problem is **most hydrogen production costs don't follow steep learning curves** - they're chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical infrastructure
- **"I want to not pick losers"** rather than pick winners
- We shouldn't mislead another generation: **"Telling another generation of children that hydrogen is the solution... with our current knowledge of thermodynamics, current knowledge of the economics... is almost tantamount to child abuse"**

### The Ammonia Trade Question

Both agree there will be global ammonia trade, but disagree on implications:

**Rakhou**: Sees this as evidence hydrogen infrastructure will develop, with ammonia cracked back to hydrogen in importing countries.

**Liebreich**: 
- Ammonia trades at $350-500/ton globally
- Green ammonia projects cost $600-800+ per ton (India's auction: $600 *after* subsidies and transmission fee waivers; real cost ~$1,000)
- **Why not just import gray ammonia and pay the carbon price?** It would be hundreds of dollars per ton cheaper
- The fundamental problem: **"You can only blend in your hydrogen if you have built it. But to build it, you have to pay that day in day out for 15 years"**

### The Electricity Priority Argument

**Liebreich's most powerful point**: Every green hydrogen project requires green electricity. That same electricity could:
- **Push coal off the grid** (in India, China, etc.)
- Have **3x the climate impact** of making green hydrogen
- Require **dramatically less capital**
- Work faster

**"I have not heard a single person give a good reason why that's a good idea"** - spending more money to do one-third of the climate good.

**Rakhou's counter**: Grid connection waiting times are 10-15 years; we can't fix grids fast enough.

**Liebreich's response**: "Stop spending money on hydrogen and fix that problem" - it's cheaper, faster, and has bigger climate impact.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Hydrogen Ladder

Both reference the "hydrogen ladder" - a framework ranking hydrogen use cases from most to least sensible:
- **Top layers** (Rakhou's focus): Hard-to-abate industrial uses like fertilizers, petrochemicals, possibly steel
- **Bottom layers**: Residential heating, passenger cars, etc. (largely discredited)

**Rakhou's position**: "Focus on the top two layers... by 2050 we will have a climate reset"

**Liebreich's position**: Even the top layers face severe economic challenges requiring massive subsidies.

### The "Neapolitan Cup and Ball Game"

**Liebreich's term** for how hydrogen advocates present costs: They quote cheap solar electricity prices (€35/MWh) but don't mention:
- Solar only runs 8 hours/day
- Requires 3x the electrolyzer capacity
- Or expensive battery storage
- The real delivered cost is much higher

### The Three-Part Cost Structure

Understanding hydrogen costs requires breaking them into:
1. **Electrolyzer stack** (10%) - will follow steep learning curves
2. **Plant infrastructure** (40%) - shallow learning curves (chemical/civil engineering)
3. **Electricity** (40%) - already went down its learning curve

This framework explains why hydrogen won't follow solar/battery cost trajectories.

### The 15-Year Project Finance Reality

Any hydrogen infrastructure requires **15 years of sustained revenue** to justify project finance. This kills:
- The resilience argument (can't build fast enough for crises)
- The "wait for demand" argument (need revenue commitments upfront)
- The "hedge against high gas prices" argument (need sustained high prices, not spikes)

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Liebreich's Contrarian Views (Relative to Hydrogen Hype):

1. **Blue hydrogen is the practical solution** for existing 100 million tons/year of gray hydrogen - despite being unpopular with those who "hate oil and gas companies so much that they want to spend trillions of dollars more on a fantasy route"

2. **Germany's €18 billion hydrogen pipeline network will go bankrupt** - it's subsidized up to a point, then must be self-sustaining, but there won't be enough supply or demand

3. **The RWE-TotalEnergies project** (600km apart, 80% subsidized) only exists because RWE gets subsidies and Total avoids EU penalties - not because it makes economic sense

4. **Hydrogen is worse than doing nothing** in some cases - it diverts green electricity from higher-impact uses like displacing coal

5. **No serious analyst now thinks hydrogen will reach $1/kg by 2050** (even BCG corrected their projections to €5/kg in Central Europe)

### Rakhou's Contrarian Views (Relative to Hydrogen Skepticism):

1. **Carbon pricing, not subsidies** - "I hate subsidies" - should drive hydrogen adoption through market mechanisms

2. **The IRA $3/kg subsidy cancellation was good for hydrogen** - forces industry to focus on genuinely economic projects

3. **Hydrogen as insurance** has value even if rarely used - just having the capability caps gas prices

4. **We need optionality** - picking winners (electrification only) is dangerous; hydrogen provides necessary backup

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Policy Makers:

**Liebreich's recommendations**:
- **Fix grid connection problems** instead of funding hydrogen (cheaper, faster, bigger climate impact)
- Require **transparent carbon price calculations** for all hydrogen subsidies (UK's £2.4 billion program hides carbon prices "well into the hundreds" of pounds)
- Force oil/gas companies to **properly decarbonize existing hydrogen** (blue hydrogen with real carbon capture and fugitive emissions control)
- **Stop misleading the public** about hydrogen's role - European Court of Auditors, French Cour des Comptes, and German Bundesrechnungshof all agree a "reset" is needed

**Rakhou's recommendations**:
- Implement **sustained carbon pricing** (not subsidies) for 10-15 years
- Support **continued R&D and deployment** to drive learning curves
- Focus on **top two layers of hydrogen ladder** (industrial uses)
- Build **shared infrastructure** (pipelines) with public support until volumes justify private operation

### For Investors:

**Red flags** (per Liebreich):
- Projects requiring >€5/kg hydrogen in Europe
- Offshore wind-to-hydrogen projects (starting at ~€8/kg)
- Hydrogen for transportation (cars, trucks, taxis)
- Hydrogen for heating
- Projects depending on sustained high fossil fuel prices
- eSAF projects requiring $250/ton carbon prices

**Opportunities** (per Rakhou):
- Nordic and Iberian projects at €4/kg
- Chinese projects targeting $2.25/kg by 2030
- Steel and heavy industry applications
- Companies with existing hydrogen infrastructure/expertise
- His 50-stock hydrogen portfolio (up 13% YTD - though this wasn't challenged on risk-adjusted returns)

### For Understanding Macro:

1. **Hidden inflation from hydrogen mandates**: EU's 1% eSAF blending = 4% flight cost increase by 2030

2. **Massive capital requirements**: Just decarbonizing Europe's existing 7 million tons of hydrogen needs **€400+ billion** (at €4/kg cost premium over 15 years)

3. **LNG glut coming**: Gas strategists see oversupply ahead, which would make hydrogen even less competitive

4. **Europe's competitiveness problem**: Spending hundreds of billions on expensive hydrogen while competitors use cheap fossil fuels or prioritize electrification

5. **The geopolitical dimension**: Europe will remain import-dependent regardless (whether fossil fuels, ammonia, or green electricity) - the question is which dependency is cheapest and most secure

### Actionable Takeaways:

**For businesses**:
- **Electrify wherever possible** - it's cheaper, proven, and improving faster
- If you must use hydrogen, focus on **existing industrial uses** (fertilizers, petrochemicals) where it's already essential
- **Demand transparent cost breakdowns** including all subsidies and implied carbon prices
- For heavy transport, **electric is already competitive** in some markets - pilot before committing to hydrogen

**For citizens/voters**:
- **Question hydrogen subsidies** - ask what the implied carbon price is
- Understand that **hydrogen mandates = hidden costs** (flights, industrial products)
- Support **grid improvements** over hydrogen infrastructure
- Recognize the **opportunity cost** - money spent on hydrogen isn't spent on proven solutions

**For the climate movement**:
- **Don't let perfect be the enemy of good** - blue hydrogen (with proper carbon capture) may be the pragmatic path for existing hydrogen use
- **Prioritize high-impact solutions** - green electricity displacing coal beats green electricity making hydrogen
- **Beware greenwashing** - "green hydrogen" projects often have terrible economics that undermine climate action

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On the fundamental problem**:
> "We don't need to burn things. What we need is... warm homes and cold beers and MRI scanners... the electric economy. Nothing about that says we have to be burning." - **Liebreich**

**On the resilience argument**:
> "You'd be much better off just buying the gas for the equivalent of €5 for the month and saying 'ouch' than spending 15 years building hydrogen capacity you might use once." - **Liebreich**

**On misleading future generations**:
> "Telling another generation of children that hydrogen is the solution... with our current knowledge of thermodynamics, current knowledge of the economics of this stuff, current knowledge of 50 years of failure to do this stuff... is almost tantamount to child abuse." - **Liebreich**

**On picking winners vs. losers**:
> "I want to not pick losers. Right. Let's be clear about that." - **Liebreich** (in response to accusation of "picking winners")

**On the need for optionality**:
> "I think we need optionality in this world... When you add that up - geopolitical resilience, grid problems, economics of starting now and building up the sector capability - in that world, I think we need optionality including hydrogen to have a livable planet." - **Rakhou**

**On subsidies**:
> "I hate subsidies... we need carbon pricing not subsidies." - **Rakhou**

**Final Assessment**: This debate crystallizes the hydrogen controversy. Liebreich brings devastating economic analysis showing hydrogen is 4-12x more expensive than alternatives across most use cases, with limited potential for cost reduction due to the physics and engineering realities. Rakhou argues for sustained investment to build optionality and energy security, focusing on industrial uses. The moderator's observation is telling: unlike EVs (which are simply better than ICE vehicles), hydrogen lacks a clear advantage in any major use case. The debate suggests hydrogen's role will be far more limited than the "hydrogen economy" vision - likely confined to niche industrial applications where alternatives don't exist, rather than the transformative energy carrier once imagined.
