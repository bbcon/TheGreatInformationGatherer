# Why Is It So Hard to Clean Up Global Shipping? | Ep229: Tristan Smith

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest Background:** Professor Tristan Smith leads the UCL Energy Institute's research group on shipping decarbonization. A naval architect and engineer by background, he transitioned from designing warships and nuclear submarines around 2010 to focus on maritime climate solutions. He has attended IMO (International Maritime Organization) meetings for 15 years, providing him unique insight into both the technical and political dimensions of shipping decarbonization.

**Main Topic:** The episode examines the dramatic failure of IMO negotiations in October 2024, where a carefully crafted emissions reduction policy—agreed in principle in April—was derailed at the last minute by aggressive US diplomatic intervention.

**Key Thesis:** Global shipping represents a critical but politically complex decarbonization challenge. While technical solutions exist and most countries supported the proposed regulations, geopolitical power dynamics—particularly US pressure tactics—can override multilateral consensus, threatening both climate goals and the integrity of international cooperation.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The IMO Regulatory Framework and Its Unique Characteristics

**The Question:** How does international shipping governance work, and why is it different from other UN processes?

**Smith's Perspective:** The IMO is a UN agency headquartered in London, originally established after the Titanic disaster to set safety standards. It evolved to address environmental issues, with greenhouse gas regulations only emerging in the early 2010s. **The organization operates under the Marpol (Marine Pollution) convention, which has unusually strong enforcement mechanisms** compared to other UN bodies.

**Key Insight:** The IMO's power dynamics are fascinating and unusual. **Voting power is weighted by ship tonnage registered under each flag**, meaning countries like Panama, Marshall Islands, and Liberia—tax havens for ship registration—hold disproportionate influence. This creates a very different dynamic than emissions-based frameworks like UNFCCC.

**Supporting Evidence:** Smith notes that unlike UNFCCC, **the IMO can make decisions by majority vote rather than requiring unanimity**, making it potentially more effective at implementing binding regulations. The sulfur regulation (removing sulfur from marine fuel) demonstrated high global compliance rates, proving the IMO's enforcement capability.

### The Failed April 2024 Agreement

**The Question:** What was actually proposed, and why did it matter?

**Smith's Perspective:** The policy package consisted of:
- **A mandate to reduce greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels by 65%** (on a well-to-wake basis, including upstream emissions and methane slip)
- **A two-tier penalty structure**: $100/ton for minor non-compliance, $380/ton for continued fossil fuel use
- **Incentives for "zero or near-zero" fuels** (below 19g CO2e per megajoule)
- **Revenue distribution to support just transition** in low-income countries and small island states

**Key Mechanisms:** The regulation targets fuel intensity rather than operational efficiency directly. This means **it would effectively end LNG as a marine fuel** and significantly reduce oil demand in shipping. Wind, solar, and direct electrification would be treated as zero-emission "fuels" and incentivized accordingly.

**Critical Detail:** This was an **intensity-based regulation, not a total emissions cap**, meaning efficiency improvements (slow steaming, hull modifications) wouldn't directly count—though they'd reduce fuel consumption and thus costs.

### The US Intervention and Diplomatic Pressure Campaign

**The Question:** What happened in the week leading up to the vote, and how did the US derail the agreement?

**Smith's Perspective:** Despite government shutdown, **the US deployed significant diplomatic resources and used unprecedented pressure tactics**. Countries that had supported the policy in April were threatened with visa revocations, tariffs, and other economic consequences. Individual diplomats were personally targeted.

**The Mechanism:** Saudi Arabia formally proposed a 12-month deferral, which passed by majority vote before the actual adoption vote could occur. **Only 6 countries initially opposed the policy in April; by October, enough had been pressured to change positions** to secure the deferral.

**Smith's Candid Assessment:** "It felt apocalyptic... This is not about zombies or meteors. This is just about an appalling deployment of pressure." He describes witnessing countries that are **existentially threatened by climate change abandoning their principled positions** under duress—something he'd never seen in 15 years of IMO meetings.

**Why the US Cared So Much:** Smith argues the US has **pinned economic hopes on LNG exports**. The IMO regulation would have effectively killed the maritime LNG market by 2031-2032, threatening a key US energy export strategy. "This is actually a regulatory body that when it passes something in Marpol... has a material effect on the global demand for oil and gas."

### The Technology Debate: What Fuels Can Actually Decarbonize Shipping?

**The Question:** Are e-fuels and ammonia really the answer, or should we wait for better technologies?

**Smith's Perspective:** After 8 years of annual analysis, **his team consistently finds e-fuels and ammonia are the least-cost pathway** for ocean-going shipping. He strongly pushes back against "wait and see" approaches.

**On Battery Electrification:** Heroic assumptions about battery cost reductions still only get to **single-digit percentage reductions** in shipping emissions. Batteries work for domestic and short-haul shipping (Baltic Sea, for example) but **cannot handle 2-4 week ocean crossings** that dominate international shipping's energy use.

**On Nuclear:** While technically feasible, **the liability and insurance frameworks don't exist** for international nuclear-powered merchant vessels. "If I built a nuclear-powered ship to sail from the UK to the US... what if it crashes into Ireland?" The legal complexity requires multilateral frameworks from both IMO and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Additionally, **crewing costs would be much higher** than the 15-person crews on modern commercial ships.

**On LNG:** The EU's current regulations **perversely incentivize LNG** by allowing banking of credits. The IMO regulation would have closed this loophole. Smith emphasizes that **LNG is only viable until 2031-2032** under the proposed carbon pricing, making new LNG vessel orders economically irrational.

**The E-fuel Reality:** Current green ammonia prices are around **$2,000/ton in fuel oil equivalent**. Smith argues this isn't prohibitively expensive when distributed across global shipping, and that **shipping costs are relatively price inelastic**—even significant fuel cost increases have minimal GDP impact (less than 1% even for low-income countries).

### The "Pause and Wait" Debate

**The Host's Challenge:** Worthington suggests perhaps shipping should wait—focus electrons on direct electrification (2-9x more carbon reduction per electron) in easier sectors like road transport, and revisit shipping in a decade when technology might be better.

**Smith's Rebuttal:** This is **dangerous procrastination that enables technology lock-in**. Currently **60% of the ship order book is LNG dual-fuel vessels**. Ships have 30-40 year lifespans, and retrofit costs are massive. Waiting another decade would mean:
- Continued LNG vessel orders through the 2030s
- A fleet locked into fossil fuels well into the 2050s-2070s
- A much harder, more expensive transition later

**The S-Curve Argument:** Smith challenges the assumption that breakthrough technologies will emerge. **"There are good fundamentals in the laws of physics that tell us how much energy you need to do various different things."** The sector needs to commit to a pathway now to enable the necessary investment and infrastructure development.

**On Electron Scarcity:** Most e-fuel projects Smith tracks are **"islanded production"—not connected to grids**. For example, Inner Mongolia green ammonia projects don't compete with UK or European grid decarbonization. "I don't agree that there's a finite supply of renewable electricity components... Look at what's happening with AI. How has so much capital and hardware suddenly become viable?"

### The Equity and Development Dimension

**Smith's Key Point:** Many low-income countries **saw the IMO regulation as an energy transition opportunity** that climate finance and UNFCCC weren't providing. Countries without gas grids or significant renewables investment could potentially become e-fuel producers.

**The Revenue Mechanism:** The penalty fees would create **$5-10 billion annually** for just transition support and early adoption incentives. This represented a significant climate finance mechanism that would be **controlled by the maritime sector rather than traditional climate finance channels**.

**The Irony:** Countries most threatened by climate change were pressured into abandoning a policy that would have both reduced emissions and provided them development opportunities.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Technology Lock-In Framework

**The Concept:** Maritime assets have 30-40 year lifespans. **Decisions made today about ship propulsion systems determine emissions for decades**. Retrofit costs are prohibitively expensive because of the engineering complexity of mid-life surgery on vessels.

**Application:** This means **"wait and see" approaches are actually "lock in fossil fuels" approaches**. The current window for influencing the 2030s-2050s fleet is closing rapidly. If LNG dual-fuel vessels continue to dominate orders, the sector's decarbonization is pushed to the 2060s-2070s.

### The Intensity vs. Efficiency Distinction

**The Framework:** Regulations can target either:
- **Fuel intensity** (emissions per unit of energy)
- **Operational efficiency** (emissions per unit of transport work)

**Key Insight:** The proposed IMO regulation focused on fuel intensity, which **directly drives fuel switching** but only indirectly incentivizes efficiency. Existing IMO efficiency regulations have weak enforcement (the penalty is "write a report"), making them ineffective at changing behavior.

**Application:** Understanding this distinction clarifies why the regulation would kill LNG (high methane slip increases intensity) while not directly rewarding slow steaming or hull improvements.

### The Electron Efficiency Hierarchy

**The Concept:** Using renewable electricity directly provides **2-9x more carbon reduction** than converting it to e-fuels. This creates a hierarchy:
1. Direct electrification (batteries, grid power)
2. Hybrid systems
3. E-fuels (least efficient)

**The Debate:** Worthington argues this means shipping should wait. Smith counters that:
- Most e-fuel production is islanded (doesn't compete with grid decarbonization)
- Capital isn't finite (see AI investment boom)
- Waiting creates worse lock-in problems
- The IMO regulation only targets **5% energy substitution initially**—a low-risk experiment

### The Multilateral Pressure Dynamics Model

**Traditional Model:** Countries use positive incentives (investment, trade deals) and moderate negative pressure (withholding benefits) in negotiations.

**The New Model:** The US deployed **existential threats** (tariffs, visa revocations, sanctions) against individual diplomats and small countries with no capacity to resist. This represents a **qualitative shift in how multilateral processes can be disrupted**.

**Implication:** If this becomes normalized, **multilateral climate governance may be fundamentally broken**. The actor with the most coercive power can override consensus regardless of scientific evidence or majority support.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### "The IMO Regulation Isn't Forcing Rapid Transition—It's a Modest Experiment"

**The Take:** Contrary to narratives about green zealotry and forced transition, Smith argues the regulation was **carefully designed to be incremental**. It only targets 5% energy substitution initially, allows continued fossil fuel use (with penalties), and has a 5-year review cycle.

**The Reasoning:** "It's a relatively near-term low risk experiment and the cost of distributing a small percentage of the fuel being substituted for a long run solution in order to derisk this is distributed around a global fleet at a relatively low cost."

**The Evidence:** The effective carbon price is only **$10-12/ton**—far lower than most carbon pricing schemes. The $5-10 billion annual cost is modest when distributed across global shipping.

### "Shipping Cost Increases Won't Significantly Harm Development"

**The Take:** Even with 2-3x fuel cost increases, **GDP impacts would be less than 1%** even for low-income countries. Shipping is relatively price inelastic.

**The Reasoning:** Current shipping is so cheap that we move goods irrationally. Smith cites the example of **catching shellfish in the North Atlantic, shipping them to Asia for shelling, then shipping them back to Europe**—enabled purely by ultra-cheap energy.

**The Implication:** Higher fuel costs would rationalize trade patterns and have minimal economic impact, while the revenue mechanism would actually **benefit low-income countries through just transition funding**.

### "Nuclear Propulsion Isn't the Silver Bullet People Think"

**The Take:** While technically feasible, **nuclear propulsion faces insurmountable liability and insurance challenges** for commercial shipping, plus higher crewing costs.

**The Reasoning:** Military vessels operate under different legal frameworks. A commercial nuclear vessel that crashes in international waters or another country's territory creates **unresolvable liability questions**. No insurance company would cover it without a comprehensive multilateral legal framework—which doesn't exist and would take decades to negotiate.

**The Physics:** Even if engineering challenges were solved, **the capital costs are so high that running costs become trivial**, leading to faster ships rather than cheaper shipping. The economics don't clearly beat e-fuels when all factors are considered.

### "We Accidentally Geoengineered the Planet with Sulfur Regulations"

**The Take:** The IMO's successful sulfur regulation (removing sulfur from marine fuel to reduce air pollution) **removed significant aerosol cooling**, potentially contributing to recent warming acceleration—a "termination shock."

**The Context:** This was briefly discussed during sulfur regulation debates in the late 2010s, but **the IMO's mandate is to control pollution, not manage climate tradeoffs**. The organization isn't structured to make sophisticated multi-parameter environmental decisions.

**The Implication:** We need **more mature conversations about inadvertent and intentional geoengineering**, but it's unclear which governance body should handle this. The IMO can't be given sole responsibility for managing planetary-scale interventions.

### "The US Intervention Might Be Specifically About LNG, Not General Climate Opposition"

**The Take:** The unprecedented US pressure campaign might not signal their approach to all climate negotiations—it might be **specifically because IMO regulations materially threaten US LNG export strategy**.

**The Reasoning:** "Even though the government had a shutdown, they prioritized what they did last week... they clearly threw a lot of resource at this." The IMO's high compliance rates mean its regulations **actually affect global oil and gas demand**, unlike more voluntary frameworks.

**The Question:** Will the US deploy similar tactics at COP30 and other forums, or was this a special case because of direct economic interests?

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Maritime Industry and Investors

**Immediate Implications:**
- **LNG vessel orders will likely continue** in the near term, given regulatory uncertainty
- **Ammonia-ready designs** are being incorporated by forward-thinking shipowners to reduce retrofit costs
- The **60% of order book that's LNG dual-fuel** represents a massive bet that could become stranded assets if regulations eventually pass

**Investment Considerations:**
- **E-fuel production infrastructure** (particularly green ammonia in locations with cheap renewables) remains a long-term opportunity
- **Battery electrification** is viable for short-haul and domestic shipping (potentially 10% of the market)
- **Wind-assisted propulsion** will be treated favorably under intensity regulations if they're eventually adopted

**Risk Assessment:**
- Ships ordered today will operate for 30-40 years—**technology lock-in is the critical risk**
- Regulatory uncertainty is now extreme, making long-term capital allocation very difficult
- **Regional regulations** (EU, potentially China) may create fragmented compliance requirements

### For Understanding Multilateral Climate Governance

**The New Reality:**
- **Consensus-based multilateral processes are vulnerable** to coercive pressure from powerful actors
- Even **binding regulations with strong enforcement** (like IMO's Marpol) can be derailed pre-adoption
- The **integrity of UN processes** is now in question—if the IMO can be disrupted this way, what about other forums?

**COP30 and Beyond:**
- Brazil's COP30 may face **similar US disruption tactics** if negotiations threaten US fossil fuel interests
- Countries need to **prepare for unprecedented pressure campaigns** and potentially develop collective resistance strategies
- The **voluntary nature of UNFCCC** might actually protect it—the US may focus disruption on bodies with binding authority

**Alternative Pathways:**
- **Regional coalitions** (EU, potentially China-led Asian bloc) may need to move forward independently
- **Bilateral and plurilateral agreements** might be more resilient than multilateral ones
- There may be a **shift toward economic measures** (carbon border adjustments, trade requirements) rather than UN-based frameworks

### For Decarbonization Strategy and Prioritization

**The Electron Allocation Debate:**
- The tension between **direct electrification vs. e-fuels** will intensify
- Smith's argument: **Don't let perfect be the enemy of good**—islanded renewable production for e-fuels doesn't compete with grid decarbonization
- Worthington's concern: **Opportunity cost and inflation risk**—premature commitment to expensive pathways could trigger political backlash

**Sector Sequencing:**
- Road transport electrification should clearly be **prioritized for direct electron use** (2-9x more efficient)
- **Aviation and shipping may need to move in parallel** rather than waiting, due to technology lock-in risks
- The **5% initial substitution target** in the IMO proposal represents a reasonable "learning by doing" approach

**Technology Development:**
- **Ammonia and e-fuel infrastructure** needs development regardless of regulatory timeline
- **Safety and handling regulations** for ammonia as marine fuel need urgent attention
- **Well-to-wake accounting methodologies** remain contentious and need resolution (particularly for LNG methane slip)

### Actionable Takeaways

**For Policy Advocates:**
1. **Document and publicize pressure tactics** to build resistance and international solidarity
2. **Develop the technical guidelines** during the 12-month deferral so adoption can proceed quickly if political conditions change
3. **Strengthen regional alternatives** (EU regulations, potential Asian frameworks) as backup pathways
4. **Frame the revenue mechanism** as development finance, not just environmental regulation

**For Industry:**
1. **Consider ammonia-ready designs** even without regulatory certainty—retrofit costs are prohibitive
2. **Avoid long-term LNG commitments** unless confident regulations won't materialize for 10+ years
3. **Invest in battery electrification** for short-haul routes where it's already viable
4. **Engage in guideline development** at IMO to shape implementation details

**For Researchers and Analysts:**
1. **Continue annual technology assessments** to test assumptions about least-cost pathways
2. **Model regional regulation scenarios** given multilateral uncertainty
3. **Analyze the sulfur regulation's climate impact** (termination shock) more thoroughly
4. **Develop frameworks for multi-parameter environmental tradeoffs** (climate vs. acidification vs. air quality)

**For Climate Advocates:**
1. **Prepare for similar tactics** in other negotiations—this is likely a template, not an isolated incident
2. **Build coalitions of vulnerable countries** to collectively resist pressure
3. **Don't assume 2026 will be different**—the US position may harden further, not soften
4. **Develop alternative narratives** that counter "green zealot" framing with economic opportunity messaging

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On the diplomatic pressure campaign:**
> "It felt apocalyptic, you know. This is not about zombies or meteors. This is just about an appalling deployment of pressure... I've not ever seen the IMO operate in that way previously in a way where the consequences of taking a particular position are so fundamentally dire that countries that have their survival at stake choose a different position."

**On why the US cared so much:**
> "The IMO's rules, we think, will be the end of liquid natural gas as a marine fuel. We think it'll be significantly tailing off of oil as a marine fuel... This is actually a regulatory body that when it passes something in Marpol... has a material effect on the global demand for oil and gas, and in an administration which has pinned its hopes on being able to export LNG and being able to still sell oil in a few years time, that's perhaps something that they decided deserved the extra attention they gave it."

**On the danger of delay:**
> "If we express that [wait and see approach] and then use that to be seduced into a pause for a decade, we are going to lock in technologies like LNG and we are going to postpone any energy transition which the sector genuinely needs, and in our analysis there isn't a scientific justification to do that."

**On shipping's modest cost impact:**
> "When you calculate what does this do to global GDP, even what does this do to the GDP of a low-income country, we're talking about less than 1%... There's a huge way in which we can reduce those GDP effects by being more rational about what we move. There's a great anecdote that we catch shellfish in the North Atlantic, we put them on a ship, we take them to the Far East where they're shelled because there's cheaper labor, and then we take them back into the European market to sell."

**On the modest ambition of the regulation:**
> "It's not trying to force the global fleet onto ammonia in the next 5, 10 or even 15 years. It's cleverly conceived... around the concept that there will be a portion of continuation of the use of fossil fuels. There will be a portion of the fleet which is able to take action in a more incremental way... and the target on that is a 5% energy substitution."

**On technology lock-in:**
> "Ships are not designed to be disposed of like a car after 5 or 10 or 15 years. They are designed to live for 30 years. The retrofit costs are massive. If you try and do surgery in the middle of a ship's life to put something like an ammonia tank and fuel distribution system on board, it adds huge amounts of cost."
