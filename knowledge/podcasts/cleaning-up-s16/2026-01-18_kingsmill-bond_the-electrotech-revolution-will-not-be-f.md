# The Electrotech Revolution: A New Framework for Energy Transition

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest:** Kingsmill Bond, Director and Strategist at Ember (formerly with Carbon Tracker and Rocky Mountain Institute)

**Context:** This special episode was recorded at a Leadership Circle breakfast in Berlin, featuring Bond presenting Ember's new report on the "Electrotech Revolution."

**Key Thesis:** The energy transition is not about degrowth or simply doing "more fossil fuels" - it's a **technology shift** from combustion to electrons that is already happening, driven by superior economics, physics, and geopolitics. Bond argues we need to reframe the entire debate away from false solutions (like hydrogen and carbon capture) and recognize that we're witnessing the **supply, demand, and connection of electrons** creating an entirely new energy system.

**Why This Matters:** If Bond is correct about fossil fuel demand peaking, the next 5-10 years will look dramatically different from the past - making this perhaps the most important inflection point in energy history.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The "Third Way" Narrative

**The Problem with Current Framing:**
- Fossil fuel advocates argue for continued abundance through fossil fuels
- Climate activists push for degrowth, belt-tightening, and destroying existing infrastructure
- **Neither narrative explains what's actually happening on the ground**

**Bond's Alternative:** The electrotech revolution represents abundance through electrons - a technology shift, not a sacrifice story.

**Evidence that challenges conventional narratives:**
- Southeast Asia has **leapfrogged Europe** in electrification
- Two-thirds of emerging markets have **leapfrogged America** in solar deployment
- Nepal has **70% market share** for electric vehicles
- Pakistan **doubled its energy system in 3 years** using solar
- None of these facts fit the "clean energy is a rich country's toy" narrative

### The System View: Three Components Working Together

**Bond's key insight** (the page that convinced Liebreich to do the interview):
1. **New ways of producing electricity** (solar, wind)
2. **New ways of storing and distributing it** (batteries, HVDC)
3. **New ways of using it** (EVs, heat pumps, industrial electrification)

**Why this matters:** Following Carlota Perez's framework on technological revolutions, different technologies coming together at similar moments drive transformative change. The classic example: **solar was reaching deployment limits, then batteries became cheap enough to provide backup** - suddenly the combination is more than the sum of parts.

Bond cheekily adds "electrotech" as the sixth technological revolution after Perez's five (industrial revolution, steam/rail, electricity, oil/mass production, digital). Perez herself disagreed, arguing we're still in the IT revolution, but gave Bond permission to use the framework.

### The Peak Fossil Fuel Thesis

**The most important claim in the report:** We are at or near peak fossil fuel demand, but you have to look beneath the aggregate numbers to see it.

**Breaking down the system:**

**Electricity Generation:**
- OECD fossil fuel demand peaked in **2008**
- Germany peaked even earlier
- In H1 2025, for the first time, **growth in solar and wind (410 TWh) exceeded total electricity demand growth (400 TWh)** - meaning fossil fuel demand for electricity declined
- 50% of the world reached peak fossil fuel demand for electricity by 2019
- China, which has driven almost all growth in fossil electricity demand for six years, is now also peaking (per Lauri Myllyvirta's analysis)

**Industrial Sector:**
- **No growth in fossil fuels for industrial energy since 2014**
- In 9 of 14 subsectors (all light industry - food, textiles, pulp, paper), fossil demand is down **20-30% from peak**
- Iron and steel: on a plateau, not growing
- Only construction still showing growth
- **35% of industrial final energy already comes from electricity**

**Buildings:**
- **No growth since 2018**

**Transport:**
- On a **plateau since 2019**
- EVs now displacing **1.5 million barrels of oil per day** (2025)
- IEA forecasts **5 million barrels per day** displaced by 2030
- In a low-growth system, this is enough to stop growth entirely

**Liebreich's critique:** The inconvenient fact is that fossil fuel use keeps growing globally. Bond's response: Look at the pattern country by country, sector by sector - you see "the rise of the new pushing out the old" repeatedly. The aggregate masks what's happening underneath.

### Why Emerging Markets Are Leapfrogging

**The old narrative (Exxon/EIA/OPEC view):** Rising middle classes in emerging markets are condemned to follow the same fossil-fuel-intensive path as the West did a century ago, China did 25 years ago. Clean energy is a "rich man's toy."

**What's actually happening:** Emerging markets are going **straight from biomass to electrotech** - not to save the planet, but because it's:
- **Cheaper**
- **Local** (energy independence)
- **Fast to deploy**

This mirrors every other technology revolution - you don't have to replicate the old path when better technology exists.

**Examples:**
- Nepal: 90% EV market share
- Vietnam: rapid EV adoption
- Pakistan: extraordinary solar deployment
- Africa: similar patterns emerging

### The China Question

**The provocative framing:** China is driving this transition - representing **50%+ of all electrotech systems** and **more than 50% of growth**. The US, by contrast, is **10% of the system and less than 10% of growth**.

**Bond's historical analogy:** In 1850, the West showed up in China with better fossil technology. Some voices said "ignore this foreign tech and double down on the old system." The result was a "century of humiliation."

**The message to the West:** "Wake up because this is the future. This is a better series of technologies. China is leading and we need to get involved."

**Areas where Europe/US can compete:**
- Software
- Cabling and connection technologies
- Services
- High-voltage DC technologies
- Solid-state switching
- The "messy middle" of connection technologies

Liebreich notes that **Europe's grid performs better than China's** pound-for-pound, and Europe excels at many sub-technologies within HVDC and power electronics.

### The Inevitability Argument

**Bond's framework:** Three fundamental forces make this transition inevitable:
1. **Physics** (solar captures 100x more energy per unit than fossil fuels, per Ian Morris)
2. **Economics** (learning curves vs. no learning curves)
3. **Geopolitics** (energy independence, local production)

**The caveat:** Individual countries can resist (North Korea example), but it takes enormous effort to fight these forces.

**What we're negotiating:** Not the destination, but **the speed**. Even Shell's 2100 scenarios show decarbonized electricity and electrification of everything - just with different timelines.

**Liebreich's addition:** Many things are inevitable - North Korea still uses fossil fuels and digital technologies. The microeconomics driven by physics creates inevitability. We're negotiating speed, not direction.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The "Build Then Break" Principle

**Origin:** Chinese phrase, popularized by Simon Sharpe in his work (author of "Five Times Faster")

**The concept:** You must **build the new before you destroy the old**. 

**Bond's critique of the green movement:** "One of the errors we have made is to try and destroy the old before you had built the new."

**The turning point:** We needed to build the new. Now we've built enough of the new that we can start to squeeze the old. This is happening structurally in electricity generation as of 2025.

### The Two Vectors Framework

**Vector 1: Decarbonization of electricity**
- This is happening rapidly
- Solar and wind growth now exceeding demand growth

**Vector 2: Electrification of everything**
- This is the bottleneck, especially in Europe
- Germany has been **stagnant at 20% electrification since 2008**
- China has reached **30% electrification** (35% of useful energy)
- **The core task now is increasing the electrification rate**

### Primary Energy vs. Final Energy vs. Useful Energy

**A critical distinction** that Bond and Liebreich emphasize:

- **Primary energy:** What gets extracted (includes all the waste heat from combustion)
- **Final energy:** What reaches end users
- **Useful energy:** What actually performs work

**Why this matters:** Electricity is currently ~22% of final energy globally, but **~35% of useful energy**. When Chris Wright (US Energy Secretary) says solar could only provide 20% even if you "carpeted the world," he's missing:
1. The electrification vector (final energy share will grow)
2. The efficiency gains (useful energy is what matters)

**The missing piece in energy accounting:** The Lawrence Livermore Sankey diagram shows all energy sources - coal, oil, gas, geothermal, solar - but **completely omits ambient heat captured by heat pumps**, which already represents **~1.5% of primary energy and ~3% of useful energy** in the US.

### The Carlota Perez Technology Revolution Framework

**The five historical revolutions:**
1. Industrial Revolution
2. Steam and Rail
3. Steam and Electricity
4. Oil and Mass Production
5. Digital/IT

**Bond's addition:** Electrotech (photovoltaics) as the sixth

**The pattern:** Each revolution involves multiple technologies maturing simultaneously and combining to create transformation.

**Ian Morris's "Four Fs" framework** (which Bond extends):
- Foragers
- Farmers  
- Fossil Fuels
- **Photovoltaics** (Bond's addition)

Each transition represents a **100-fold increase in energy capture**. We now have the capacity to seize 100x as much energy from the sun.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Hydrogen and Carbon Capture Are "Fake Solutions"

**Bond's blunt assessment:** "It's tragic that so many clever people and so much time and talent has been poured into an obvious dead end."

**The fundamental insight:** Both technologies are attempts to **continue the combustion economy** - either burn it but capture the carbon, or burn something else. 

**The bigger picture:** "Humanity has been burning stuff for tens of thousands of years. Now for the first time in history we've figured out a way to harness and use the power of the sun directly without burning it ourselves. That's the great story."

**The problem with Europe's approach:** Loading costs for hydrogen and CCS onto electricity prices, which **retards the electrification we actually need**.

### Nuclear Doesn't Matter (Much)

**Bond's position:** Nuclear has been stuck at **~3,000 TWh of generation for 40 years**, with rising costs, competing against solar and wind which have gone from nothing to **4,000 TWh** with falling costs.

**The learning curve argument:** "Nuclear is simply a technology which doesn't have a learning curve competing against technologies which do."

**The realistic scenario:** Maybe nuclear grows from 3-4 TWh to 5 TWh, but in the same timeframe, **solar and wind will grow from 4 TWh to 40-50 TWh**.

**The pragmatic view:** If you have nuclear, probably keep it (Germany). But it won't be the primary driver of electricity system growth.

**Liebreich's counterpoint:** Countries will build nuclear anyway for co-benefits (food industry, medical, defense), and some countries can build much cheaper than Europe/North America. AI data centers may also drive nuclear due to difficulty of powering them with distributed solutions.

### Europe's Strategic Mistake: Optimizing Carbon Instead of Cost

**Bond's critique:** "Europe has made a mistake by seeking to optimize carbon immediately in this transition."

**The problem:** Europe has lost sovereignty because **60% of primary energy demand is imported fossil fuels**.

**The solution:** 
1. **Optimize cost in the electricity system** (not carbon)
2. **Lean into electrification technologies**
3. **Stop pricing electricity off gas**
4. **Remove fake solution costs** from electricity prices

**The outcome:** This approach would achieve decarbonization more effectively AND gain energy independence.

**Liebreich's agreement:** "Electrification first" - drive volume through the system (which drives costs down), then finish cleaning the electricity. Don't load costs onto electricity that prevent electrification.

### The US Is a Laggard, Not a Leader

**Challenging American exceptionalism:** The US represents only **10% of the electrotech system and less than 10% of growth** - it was a laggard and remains one.

**What happens if the US resists:** Technologies end up deployed elsewhere. The latest IEA forecast downgraded US solar/wind but **upgraded Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South Asia** - net effect roughly the same.

**The optimistic scenario:** Trump might pivot when he realizes quick energy for AI requires "something easy which is solar."

**Liebreich's scenario:** Lots of flexible gas plants get built for AI, the AI bubble bursts, and that flexible gas peaking keeps lights on during intervals between wind and sun.

### We're Not Optimistic, We're Realistic

**Bond pushes back on characterization:** "I wouldn't say it's very optimistic because we're going to get pretty close to two degrees."

**The goal:** "We're not saying what we want to happen or what should happen, but what is happening."

**The finance discipline:** "Much better to be roughly right than precisely wrong."

**Critiqued from both sides:** Fossil fuel advocates say they're wrong; green advocates say they're not optimistic enough.

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Investors and Markets

**The peak hunting imperative:** As Bond notes, "In finance, you're always hunting for peaks. You're always hunting for turning points. It's not change, it's the first derivative of change or second derivative of change."

**If the peak thesis is correct:** The next 5-10 years will look completely different from the past - this is the most important inflection point for energy investment.

**Where the money will be made:** Not in the headline technologies (solar panels, wind turbines) but in **"the messy middle" - connection technologies** where Europe has advantages.

**The $1.8 trillion rent problem:** The report documents:
- **$1.8 trillion in rents** to fossil fuel industry (licenses, royalties, profits)
- **$400 billion in subsidies**
- **$160 million per year in US lobbying** alone

These represent enormous forces resisting change, but also enormous capital that will be redirected.

**Scenario planning:** Even fossil fuel companies like Shell have 2100 scenarios showing decarbonized electricity and full electrification - they just show different paths. Scenarios "tend towards reality" after the careers of people who produce them end.

### For Policy and Industrial Strategy

**The electrification imperative:** The bottleneck is no longer electricity generation - it's **electrification of end uses**, especially in Europe.

**Pricing reform needed:**
1. Stop pricing electricity off gas
2. Remove hydrogen and CCS costs from electricity
3. Make electricity cheaper to drive electrification

**The competitiveness question:** Europe can gain advantage through:
- Energy independence (replacing 60% imported fossil fuels)
- Lower energy costs through electrification
- Excellence in connection technologies and grid management
- Speed of deployment

**The sovereignty argument:** This isn't just about climate - it's about **energy independence and economic competitiveness**.

### For Understanding Macro Trends

**The leapfrog pattern:** Emerging markets aren't following the Western development path - they're jumping straight to superior technology. This has profound implications for:
- Oil demand forecasts
- Development economics
- Geopolitical power dynamics

**The China reality:** Like it or not, China is driving this transition. The West can either compete or fall behind. The historical analogy to 1850 is pointed: ignoring superior foreign technology led to a "century of humiliation."

**The jobs and industry question:** The transition from fossil hardware to electrotech hardware is happening. Countries that don't pivot will lose industrial capacity and jobs.

**The data center wildcard:** AI's enormous energy demands could either accelerate the transition (if powered by renewables) or create a temporary fossil fuel reprieve (if powered by gas). Liebreich's scenario of flexible gas plants built for an AI bubble that bursts is particularly interesting.

### Actionable Takeaways

**For businesses:**
1. **Electrify operations now** - the economics already work in most light industry
2. **Plan for peak fossil fuel demand** in your sector - it's coming sooner than consensus expects
3. **Invest in connection technologies** and the "messy middle" - that's where value will be created
4. **Don't bet on hydrogen or CCS** for your decarbonization strategy

**For policymakers:**
1. **Prioritize electrification over carbon optimization** in the near term
2. **Reform electricity pricing** to reflect actual costs, not gas prices
3. **Remove costs of "fake solutions"** from electricity bills
4. **Focus on deployment speed** - volume drives cost reduction
5. **Invest in grid and connection infrastructure** - Europe's strength area

**For investors:**
1. **Model peak fossil fuel demand** into your scenarios - it changes everything
2. **Look for opportunities in the messy middle** - software, services, connections
3. **Understand the China supply chain** - it's not going away
4. **Watch electrification rates** by country and sector - that's the key metric
5. **Be skeptical of long-term fossil fuel demand forecasts** - they consistently overestimate

**For individuals:**
1. **Electrify your home** - heat pumps and induction cooking are ready now
2. **Consider EVs** - the economics work in most markets
3. **Understand this is inevitable** - position accordingly in career and investments

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On the fundamental shift:**
> "Humanity has been burning stuff for tens of thousands of years. Now for the first time in history we've figured out a way to harness and use the power of the sun directly without burning it ourselves. That's the great story and that's what we need to be leaning into."

**On China and the West:**
> "In 1850, the West shows up in China with better fossil tech and there were siren voices which said 'No, let's ignore this foreign fossil tech and double down on the old system.' It didn't end well for them. They had a century of humiliation. Part of the argument we're now making to the West is: wake up because this is the future."

**On false solutions:**
> "It's tragic that so many clever people and so much time and talent has been poured into an obvious dead end [hydrogen and carbon capture]."

**On inevitability:**
> "There are three fundamental factors - physics, economics, and geopolitics - which are driving this change and they are very very powerful forces. It takes a lot to resist them."

**On the peak moment:**
> "In the first half of 2025, the growth in solar and wind for the first time ever in structural terms was greater than total electricity demand growth and therefore fossil fuel demand went into decline."

**On being realistic vs. optimistic:**
> "We're not saying what we want to happen or what should happen, but what is happening. We're trying to be roughly right rather than precisely wrong."

**On Europe's mistake:**
> "Europe has made a mistake by seeking to optimize carbon immediately in this transition. The problem Europe faces today is that we have lost our sovereignty because 60% of our primary energy demand is imported fossil fuels."

---

**Final Assessment:** Bond and Ember's "Electrotech Revolution" framework provides a compelling alternative narrative to both fossil fuel abundance and climate degrowth stories. The key insight is recognizing this as a **technology shift driven by superior economics**, not a moral crusade requiring sacrifice. The peak fossil fuel thesis, if correct, represents the most important inflection point in energy history. The practical implication is clear: **electrification is now the priority**, not further cleaning of electricity generation. Whether Bond is precisely right on timing matters less than whether the directional thesis is correct - and the evidence he presents is substantial. The question isn't whether this transition happens, but whether the West wakes up in time to compete with China's lead, and whether we move fast enough to avoid the worst climate impacts.
