# The Enormous Ambition Of Germany's New Grid Build Out | Ep233: Tim Meyerjürgens

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest:** Tim Meyerjürgens, CEO of TenneT Germany, one of Germany's four transmission system operators (TSOs)

**Why He's Relevant:** TenneT Germany operates the most critical transmission corridor in Germany's energy transition—connecting the wind-rich north (including offshore wind from Denmark) to the industrial demand centers in the south (Bavaria). The company is the largest TSO in Germany by regulated asset base and is undertaking one of Europe's most ambitious grid infrastructure programs.

**Main Topics:**
- Germany's €65 billion grid investment program (2025-2029)
- The recent corporate restructuring and €9.5 billion equity raise
- Managing the physics and finance of the energy transition
- Grid connection queues and permitting challenges
- Offshore wind integration and North Sea cooperation

**Key Thesis:** Grid investment is not just necessary infrastructure spending—it's economically self-justifying. Every euro invested in transmission reduces at least two euros in system service costs (redispatch, constraints) over the long term. The challenge isn't whether to invest, but how to finance it fast enough and navigate permitting to keep pace with renewable deployment.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Economics of Grid Investment

**The Question:** Why does Germany need such massive grid investment, and won't this just increase costs for consumers?

**Meyerjürgens' Perspective:** The counterintuitive answer is that **grid investment actually reduces total system costs**. While wholesale electricity prices are falling due to cheap renewables, system service costs (redispatch, constraint payments) have exploded and now represent **half of TenneT's grid tariffs**.

**Key Mechanism Explained:** When there's insufficient transmission capacity, the grid operator must pay generators to turn down (curtail) in areas with excess supply and pay other generators to turn up in areas with shortage. These "redispatch" costs are enormous and growing.

**Supporting Evidence:** 
- The **Ganderkesee line** (60 km AC line south of Bremen): Cost €1 billion, saved €500 million in redispatch costs in its first year alone. **Fully paid back in two years.**
- The **Wahle-Mecklar line**: Saved €350 million in its first year of operation
- TenneT expects transmission tariffs to remain **stable despite massive investment** because system service cost reductions offset the capital costs

**Host Challenge:** Liebreich pushed back on whether this creates a "squeeze the balloon" problem—reducing one cost while increasing another. Meyerjürgens insisted the math works: **every €1 invested saves at least €2 in system costs long-term**.

### The Permitting Crisis

**The Question:** How long does it actually take to build new transmission infrastructure in Germany?

**Meyerjürgens' Response:** The Ganderkesee line example took **20 years total—17 years of which were permitting and licensing, only 3 years of actual construction**.

**Recent Improvements:** Under the previous government (Robert Habeck as Energy Minister), emergency regulations during the Ukraine energy crisis brought timelines down to **5-8 years**. However, these emergency measures are expiring, and without permanent legislation, Germany risks reverting to 10-12 year timelines.

**The Challenge:** Even with a business-friendly government now in power, maintaining the accelerated permitting framework is uncertain. The host noted the irony: renewable projects and demand-side projects operate on 2-3 year timelines, but the connecting infrastructure takes 5-20 years—a fundamental mismatch.

### Anticipatory Investment and Decoupled Planning

**The Framework:** Germany has solved the "chicken and egg" problem of grid investment through a **scenario-based, anticipatory investment system** that's completely decoupled from actual project commitments.

**How It Works:**
1. Government sets climate targets (net zero by 2045—constitutionally mandated)
2. These are broken down into generation profiles (how much solar, wind, etc.) and demand scenarios (data centers, heat pumps, industrial electrification)
3. The four TSOs develop a **Grid Development Plan** based on three scenarios
4. The regulator (BNetzA) publicly consults and approves the plan
5. The plan goes to Parliament and becomes **law**—specific projects are legally mandated
6. The plan is **revised every two years** to adjust to reality

**Key Insight:** This is fundamentally different from systems where TSOs must wait for both supply and demand to materialize before investing. As Meyerjürgens explained, it's like a municipality building roads and electrical infrastructure *before* attracting industry, not after.

**The 2045 Vision:** The current Grid Development Plan now looks all the way to 2045 (the net zero target) rather than just 10 years ahead. This helps with public acceptance—people see the complete plan rather than a "salami tactic" of incremental additions.

**Risk Management:** Liebreich asked what happens if demand doesn't materialize—does the same investment get divided by fewer users, raising prices? Meyerjürgens acknowledged this country-level risk but noted that as a regulated company, TenneT is protected. The biennial review process helps keep forecasts aligned with reality.

### The Grid Connection Queue Crisis

**The Problem:** TenneT has received requests for **250 GW of battery storage** connections at the transmission level—**three times Germany's peak load**. Across Europe, there's roughly 2 terawatts of backed-up projects waiting for grid connections.

**Root Cause:** Germany operates on a **"first come, first serve"** principle for grid connections. This has created a race where everyone rushes to get in the queue, regardless of whether they'll actually build, completely masking real demand signals.

**The Perverse Incentive:** With Germany as a single price zone, batteries on opposite sides of bottlenecks receive the same price signal. This means some batteries **support the system** (charging when there's excess supply, discharging when there's shortage) while others on the wrong side of constraints **work against the system** (doing the opposite of what's helpful).

**Proposed Solution:** TenneT advocates moving from "first come, first serve" to a **maturity and system-support criteria system**:
- Has the developer secured land?
- Is there an investment decision?
- Is the supply chain secured?
- Does the project's location support system needs or exploit them?

### The Zonal Pricing Debate

**The Context:** Germany has a single electricity price zone despite major bottlenecks between the wind-rich north and demand-heavy south. About 25% of the time, this creates perverse flows where interconnectors import electricity when Germany should be exporting (because the price signal doesn't reflect internal constraints).

**The Obvious Solution:** Split Germany into multiple price zones (like Sweden did, or as exists in Italy). This would send proper locational signals for where to build batteries, data centers, and other flexible loads.

**Why Germany Won't Do It (According to Meyerjürgens):**

1. **Time:** Would take 4-5 years to implement
2. **Moving Target:** By the time zonal pricing is implemented, TenneT's investments will have resolved current bottlenecks, and constraints will be in different locations
3. **Political Impossibility:** Germany has 16 federal states with different interests. Southern states (Bavaria) would see higher prices, northern states lower prices. "It's such an emotional topic" that getting to substantive discussion is nearly impossible
4. **Alternative Approach:** Focus on grid investment to eliminate bottlenecks and use other incentives (like the maturity criteria system) to dispatch batteries and flexible loads appropriately

**Host's Skepticism:** Liebreich noted that Sweden implemented zonal pricing in 15 months, questioning the 4-5 year timeline. He also challenged whether "copper plating" (making the grid so robust that electricity can go anywhere) is realistic given the scale of offshore wind development planned.

**Meyerjürgens' Counter:** Germany isn't just serving German demand—it's facilitating **pan-European flows** (Nordics to Southern Europe, East to West). This European dimension makes the investment worthwhile even if it seems excessive for Germany alone.

### The Offshore Wind and North Sea Integration Challenge

**The Scale:** TenneT has been operating HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) offshore systems for 15 years—for much of that time, the only operator globally doing so. Currently connects 10 GW to the German mainland, but there's **300 GW of potential** in the North Sea alone.

**The Efficiency Problem:** Traditional "radial" connections (point-to-point from wind farm to shore) are inefficient:
- Wind farms typically operate 4,000-4,500 hours per year (about 50% capacity factor)
- With wake effects from crowded wind farms, this drops to 2,500-2,200 hours (25% utilization)
- The expensive HVDC infrastructure sits idle 75% of the time

**The Solution:** **Hybrid interconnectors**—combine wind farm connections with country-to-country interconnections. Example: The Lion Link project between Netherlands and UK adds just 20 km of cable but creates a full interconnector on top of the wind farm connection, boosting utilization to 8,000 hours per year.

**The Pan-European Vision:** Rather than each country connecting its wind farms individually, create a **meshed North Sea grid** where wind farms connect to each other and countries connect through this web. This requires cooperation between TSOs around the North Sea (including UK and Norway, both outside the EU).

**Investment Split:** About **half of TenneT's €65 billion** is offshore (wind connections and interconnectors), half is onshore (the copper plate connecting north to south).

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The "Every €1 Saves €2" Investment Framework

**The Model:** Grid investment shouldn't be viewed as a cost burden but as **cost reduction infrastructure**. The proper comparison is:
- Cost of new transmission line
- vs. Annual redispatch/constraint costs it eliminates
- Payback period is often 2-5 years
- Then decades of net savings

**Application:** When evaluating grid investment proposals, calculate the system service costs being incurred due to constraints. If a line can pay for itself in under 5 years through eliminated redispatch costs, it's economically compelling regardless of other benefits.

### Anticipatory vs. Reactive Investment

**Traditional Model (Reactive):**
- Wait for generation project + demand project to both materialize
- Then begin grid planning (5-20 years)
- Result: Massive bottlenecks, constraint costs, delayed transition

**German Model (Anticipatory):**
- Government sets targets → Scenarios → Grid Development Plan → Law
- Investment begins before specific projects are committed
- Biennial reviews adjust to reality
- Result: Grid ready when projects come online

**Key Insight:** The "municipality building roads before industry arrives" analogy. You don't wait for traffic jams to build roads; you build infrastructure to attract development.

### Regional vs. Pan-European Regulation

**Meyerjürgens' Framework:** Rather than trying to create unified EU-wide rules (which would take years and struggle with diverse interests from Portugal to Greece to Finland), focus on **regional solutions**:
- North Sea cooperation (offshore wind integration)
- Baltic Sea region
- Mediterranean region
- Each with countries that share similar challenges and resources

**Application:** When facing coordination challenges across diverse stakeholders, identify natural clusters with aligned interests and solve problems regionally, building up to broader integration rather than top-down.

### The Utilization Optimization Framework

**The Problem:** Expensive infrastructure (HVDC platforms, cables) with low utilization rates

**The Solution:** **Multi-purpose infrastructure**—design assets to serve multiple functions:
- Wind farm connection + interconnector = 8,000 hours vs. 2,500 hours utilization
- Marginal cost of adding functionality is small relative to utilization gain

**Application:** When planning major infrastructure, always ask: "What else could this asset do? What other flows could it carry? How can we maximize utilization?"

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Grid Investment Reduces Costs (Not Increases Them)

**Consensus View:** Massive grid investment will inevitably increase electricity costs for consumers

**Meyerjürgens' Take:** TenneT's transmission tariffs will remain **stable despite tripling the asset base** because system service cost reductions offset capital costs. In fact, long-term tariffs should decrease.

**Reasoning:** The constraint costs are already being paid—they're just hidden in redispatch payments rather than visible as grid investment. Moving costs from operating expenses (redispatch) to capital expenses (infrastructure) with a 2:1 return is economically rational.

### Zonal Pricing Is Not the Answer for Germany

**Consensus View:** Germany's single price zone with major bottlenecks is obviously inefficient; split into zones like Sweden or Italy

**Meyerjürgens' Take:** Zonal pricing would take too long to implement, would be politically impossible, and by the time it's done, the bottlenecks will have moved due to grid investment

**Reasoning:** 
- 4-5 years to implement vs. 5-8 years to build transmission that eliminates bottlenecks
- Political economy of 16 federal states makes it a non-starter
- Better to invest in copper plating and use other tools (maturity criteria, locational incentives) for flexible assets

**Host's Pushback:** Liebreich was clearly skeptical, noting Sweden's 15-month implementation and questioning whether true copper plating is achievable given offshore wind scale.

### Europe's Grid Is an Undervalued Economic Asset

**Consensus View:** Grid investment is a necessary cost of the energy transition

**Meyerjürgens' Take:** Europe's highly meshed grid with 100% availability and industry never more than tens of kilometers away is a **unique competitive advantage** that's "highly underestimated"

**Reasoning:** No other region in the world has this combination of:
- Geographic coverage (Portugal to Ukraine, Nordics to Southern Europe)
- Reliability (TenneT: 100% availability, zero outages in recent years)
- Proximity to industry
- This should be leveraged for economic development, not just viewed as transition infrastructure

### Supply Chain Constraints Require 15-Year Commitments

**Consensus View:** Order what you need when you need it; suppliers will respond to demand

**Meyerjürgens' Take:** Suppliers won't invest in capacity based on "political ambitions"—they need **long-term, committed portfolios** (10-15 years) before building new production capacity

**Reasoning:** HVDC technology has only a few global suppliers. They've seen political targets come and go. TenneT's solution: 15-year framework agreements with committed volumes (€50 billion for 14 converter platforms) in exchange for suppliers building new capacity.

**Key Quote:** Suppliers said "they cannot invest on political ambitions. They have seen so many political ambitions over the years and they have always seen that the development was different."

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Investors

**Transmission Infrastructure as an Asset Class:**
- TenneT raised €9.5 billion from institutional investors (Norwegian Oil Fund, GIC Singapore, APG Dutch pension fund)
- Targeting BBB+ credit rating (investment grade)
- Planning €10 billion/year debt issuance for five years
- Asset base tripling from €30 billion to €85 billion by 2029
- Regulated returns with long-term visibility

**The Pitch:** In a geopolitically uncertain world, investors are seeking "security and predictability." European infrastructure, particularly German transmission, is seen as a "safe haven." The business model is:
- Regulated monopoly with guaranteed returns
- Essential infrastructure that cannot fail
- Long-term, predictable cash flows
- Backed by (currently) Dutch state ownership transitioning to private capital

**Risk Factors:**
- Regulatory risk (return assumptions, allowed leverage)
- Demand risk (if electrification doesn't materialize as forecast)
- Political risk (though less than many alternatives)
- Execution risk (permitting delays, supply chain)

### For Understanding Macro

**The Hidden Cost of Transition:**
Germany's transition requires €650 billion in grid investment (transmission + distribution) through 2045. TenneT alone needs €65 billion in five years. This is:
- Not fully reflected in electricity price forecasts
- A massive capital requirement competing with other investments
- Dependent on maintaining access to debt markets at reasonable rates
- Vulnerable to permitting/political delays

**The Bottleneck Problem:**
The energy transition has a fundamental timing mismatch:
- Generation projects: 2-3 years
- Demand projects: 2-3 years  
- Grid connections: 5-20 years (even with reforms)

This creates inevitable constraint costs and connection queues. Any country rapidly deploying renewables will face this challenge.

**The Single Price Zone Distortion:**
Large single-price zones (Germany, UK) with internal constraints create perverse incentives:
- Batteries and flexible loads receive wrong locational signals
- Interconnectors flow the wrong direction ~25% of the time
- System costs increase unnecessarily
- Political economy makes zonal pricing nearly impossible to implement

**The European Dimension:**
Germany's grid investment isn't just for Germany—it's facilitating pan-European electricity flows. This raises questions about:
- Who should pay for infrastructure with cross-border benefits?
- How to coordinate investment across countries?
- Whether EU-level regulation is needed vs. regional cooperation

### For Policy and Regulation

**Permitting Reform Is Critical:**
The difference between 5-8 year and 10-20 year timelines is existential for the transition. Emergency measures that accelerated permitting are expiring. **Making these permanent should be a top priority.**

**Anticipatory Investment Frameworks Work:**
Germany's decoupled, scenario-based planning system allows grid investment to proceed without waiting for specific projects. Other countries should study this model.

**Connection Queue Reform Needed:**
"First come, first serve" creates a race that masks real demand. Moving to maturity and system-support criteria would:
- Prioritize projects likely to actually build
- Reward projects that help rather than hinder system operation
- Clear speculative applications from queues

**Supply Chain Requires Long-Term Visibility:**
Suppliers won't build capacity for political targets. Governments and TSOs need to provide:
- Long-term, legally committed project pipelines
- Standardized technical specifications across countries
- Framework agreements that justify capacity investment

**The Zonal Pricing Dilemma:**
Germany illustrates the political difficulty of implementing economically optimal solutions. When federal structures and regional interests conflict with efficient market design, the result is often suboptimal compromise (massive grid investment to copper plate rather than price signals to optimize location).

### Actionable Takeaways

**For Grid Operators:**
1. Calculate and publicize the redispatch costs that new lines would eliminate—make the economic case clear
2. Pursue long-term framework agreements with suppliers rather than project-by-project procurement
3. Share technical specifications with other TSOs to help standardize and scale supply chains
4. Design offshore infrastructure for multiple purposes (wind connection + interconnection)

**For Policymakers:**
1. Make permitting acceleration measures permanent, not emergency-only
2. Implement anticipatory investment frameworks based on scenarios, not reactive project-by-project
3. Reform connection queue systems from "first come, first serve" to maturity-based criteria
4. Consider regional cooperation (North Sea, Baltic, etc.) rather than waiting for EU-wide solutions

**For Developers:**
1. Factor in 5-8 year grid connection timelines (Germany) or longer (other countries) when planning projects
2. Engage early with TSOs on connection requirements
3. Demonstrate project maturity (land secured, financing committed, supply chain locked) to improve queue position under reformed systems
4. Consider project location relative to grid constraints and system needs

**For Investors:**
1. Transmission infrastructure offers regulated returns in an uncertain world
2. Look for TSOs with clear investment pipelines and regulatory support
3. Understand the leverage strategy (TenneT using 60/40 debt/equity to outperform regulatory returns)
4. Long-term hold horizon required (infrastructure plays out over decades)

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On the economics of grid investment:**
> "Every euro that we are investing is reducing at least two euros on the ancillary side on the long term... We commissioned two years ago a line in the south of Bremen... the investment of this line was roughly €1 billion euro. It saved in the first year of operation €500 million of redispatch cost. So after two years it's completely paid and then it's bringing benefit to the customer."

**On permitting timelines:**
> "This was one of the very first lines that we built for the energy transition. This took 20 years. 20 years. And 17 of those were permitting and licensing."

**On supply chain constraints:**
> "They said they cannot invest on political ambitions. They have seen so many political ambitions over the years and they have always seen that the development was different. So they were very very hesitant."

**On Europe's undervalued grid advantage:**
> "We have a grid that is so highly meshed about such a distance from Portugal to the Ukraine, from the Nordics to the south of Europe and at the same time industry is never more than a couple of tens of kilometers away from the grid infrastructure... We have provided 100% availability in the last years. So there has been not a single outage. This is a value for industry and for our economics that is highly underestimated."

**On the connection queue crisis:**
> "We have 250 GW of request only in the transmission grid. This is three times our peak load. And we all know that they will not all invest because they will not have a business case. Once the first 20% has invested then the business case for the rest will be gone. But we have a system where this is called a first come first serve principle... everybody's now running to be the first one in the queue."

**On the zonal pricing debate:**
> "It's such an emotional topic and what I see currently also in the German environment politics associations I don't think that is something that we can easily come to so therefore we are focusing on really investing into our grid."

---

**Final Observation:** This conversation revealed the enormous complexity of managing the energy transition's infrastructure backbone. Meyerjürgens presented a surprisingly optimistic case that massive grid investment can be economically self-justifying through system cost reductions, but the conversation also exposed deep structural challenges: permitting timelines that dwarf project development cycles, political barriers to efficient market design, supply chain constraints requiring decade-long commitments, and the fundamental question of whether "copper plating" is realistic or whether locational price signals are ultimately unavoidable. The €65 billion question is whether Germany can execute this vision fast enough to keep pace with its renewable ambitions—and whether other countries can learn from both its successes and struggles.
