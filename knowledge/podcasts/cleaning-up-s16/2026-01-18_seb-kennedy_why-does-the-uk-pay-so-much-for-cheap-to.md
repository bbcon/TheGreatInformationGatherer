# Why Does The UK Pay So Much For Cheap-To-Produce Gas?

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest:** Seb Kennedy is an energy journalist, analyst, and founder of Energy Flux, an independent news and analysis platform focused on natural gas and LNG markets. Operating between the UK and Costa Rica, Kennedy brings an independent perspective unconstrained by traditional industry pressures.

**Main Topic:** The episode examines the UK's gas market dependency, particularly its relationship with Norway, and explores whether the current market-based pricing system serves UK consumers' interests. The conversation emerged from a collaborative op-ed between Kennedy, host Bryony Worthington, and colleague Harry Benham, questioning whether a bilateral deal with Norway could provide more stable, affordable gas prices.

**Key Thesis:** Despite being connected to Norway via dedicated pipelines carrying some of the world's cheapest-to-produce gas, UK consumers pay volatile international market prices. This arrangement has transferred enormous windfall profits to Norway's sovereign wealth fund while leaving UK consumers exposed to price spikes. With structural oversupply looming in global gas markets, now may be the optimal time to renegotiate this relationship for mutual benefit.

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Global Gas Market Roller Coaster

**The Context:** Kennedy describes the gas market's extraordinary volatility over the past five years, beginning with COVID-related demand destruction, followed by a post-pandemic recovery where supply couldn't keep pace, culminating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine causing "stratospheric pricing unlike anything anybody had ever seen before."

**Key Insight:** The market now faces an **unprecedented structural shift** - a roughly 50% increase in global LNG supply capacity between now and 2029-2030. Kennedy explains: "There are big questions everyone's asking is where's all the gas going to go and in order to absorb all that gas then prices need to come down to stimulate new demand."

**The Dual Demand Destruction:** Two forces are simultaneously reducing gas demand:
- **Geopolitical disruption** from Russia's invasion causing immediate demand destruction as consumers turned down thermostats and industrial facilities shuttered
- **Structural transition** away from fossil fuels as countries pursue decarbonization targets

**Supporting Evidence:** Kennedy provides concrete examples of unexpected demand erosion:
- **China's trucking fleet:** A huge portion of China's LNG imports powers heavy-duty trucks, but electric truck sales are "going absolutely parabolic," potentially eliminating this demand segment faster than anticipated
- **Pakistan's solar revolution:** Rooftop solar installations have matched the entire capacity of Pakistan's gas-fired power stations, forcing the country to turn away contracted LNG cargoes from Qatar despite financial penalties

### The UK-Norway Gas Relationship

**The Framing:** Norway supplies approximately half of UK gas consumption through dedicated pipelines, yet prices are pegged to volatile international markets rather than production costs.

**Norway's Advantages:**
- **Among the world's cheapest production costs** - potentially lower than even Qatar
- **State control:** Equinor is 67% government-owned; pipelines were recently renationalized
- **78% tax rate** on gas revenues flowing to Norway's sovereign wealth fund (now over $1 trillion)
- **Minimal domestic demand** due to small population and abundant hydroelectric resources

**The UK's Vulnerability:**
- Complete privatization of the upstream sector with no sovereign wealth fund
- Declining North Sea production on a "secular decline trajectory"
- Only **19 days of gas storage** compared to Germany's **119 days**
- Exposure to spot market pricing despite pipeline connectivity

**The Windfall Transfer:** Kennedy estimates Equinor earns approximately **€10 billion annually** from UK gas exports alone. With futures markets pricing in a 30% decline, this represents a potential €3 billion annual revenue hit. Goldman Sachs suggests prices could fall 60%, meaning a €6 billion loss for Norway.

**The Opportunity:** Worthington argues: "Now is now not the moment to be having a big conversation with Norway about what could be done differently that benefits us both?" Both countries have left-leaning centrist governments facing far-right challenges on cost-of-living issues, creating political alignment for a deal.

### Market Ideology vs. Government Power

**The Pushback:** Kennedy describes receiving feedback that change "cannot be done" - the market is liberalized, governments are powerless, nothing will change.

**The Counterargument:** Kennedy challenges this view: "The broader context, the geopolitical context in which we're having this conversation is like well everything's changing. Look at the way that the Trump administration is wielding its enormous institutional power to push US LNG into southern and eastern Europe. It wouldn't be happening without that political push."

**Historical Context:** Gas markets used to operate on **bilateral trades and long-term contracts**. The current system of liquid, deep-traded hubs and market pricing is "a relatively new phenomenon from like the last decade and a half or so." Until Russia's invasion, liberalization delivered billions in cumulative consumer savings, but "all of those savings were wiped out the day that Russia invaded Ukraine."

**The Storage Paradox:** The UK's lack of storage capacity exemplifies market failure. Centrica shut down Rough, the UK's largest storage facility, because it wasn't profitable under market conditions. Yet this leaves the UK dangerously exposed. Adding to the absurdity, **existing storage is being converted to hydrogen** rather than maintained for gas, despite hydrogen's uncertain future.

### The US LNG Paradox

**The Contradiction:** The Trump administration aggressively promotes US LNG exports while simultaneously placing enormous domestic demand on the gas system through AI data centers and other development.

**Kennedy's Analysis:** "They want the natural gas sector to do the heavy lifting on that. Um and that raises all sorts of problems because at the same time they want to export quote unquote cheap US LNG around the world, but at the same time they're putting a huge amount of demand onto their domestic supply base which is inevitably going to increase the domestic cost."

**Trade War Complications:** China has imposed tariffs on US LNG and hasn't imported a single cargo for about a year. Yet major supply contracts between US LNG plants and Chinese buyers come into effect next year, potentially creating Atlantic basin oversupply.

**Political Vulnerability:** Worthington notes the US historically banned gas exports to keep domestic prices low. Kennedy warns that if domestic gas prices structurally increase due to export pressure, "there will be a response" from the electorate accustomed to cheap energy. A New Jersey gubernatorial candidate recently won on a platform of capping utility prices.

### The Electrification Challenge

**The Spark Spread Problem:** For electrification to make economic sense, electricity must be relatively cheap compared to gas. Currently in the UK, **electricity costs over four times more per unit than gas**, making heat pump adoption economically challenging.

**The Perverse Incentive Structure:** Worthington highlights that "all of the levies" are placed on electricity bills while "giving gas a free ride." This directly contradicts electrification goals.

**The Coming Squeeze:** If gas prices fall due to oversupply while electricity remains expensive, the economic case for electrification weakens precisely when the transition needs to accelerate.

**Kennedy's Recommendation:** "If you're trying to incentivize electrification, put as many of those social and environmental levies onto gas or onto taxation or anywhere else, and keep the electricity as cheap as possible."

**The Window of Opportunity:** Kennedy argues that with structurally cheaper gas arriving, "there'll be a little bit more headroom" to implement carbon pricing and shift levies from electricity to gas without causing immediate affordability crises.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Cost-Plus-Margin vs. Market-Pricing Framework

**The Concept:** Traditional regulated utilities operated on cost-of-production plus reasonable margin. Modern liberalized markets use marginal pricing based on supply-demand dynamics regardless of production costs.

**Application to UK-Norway:** Norway's gas costs perhaps $2-3/MMBtu to produce but sells at market rates that spiked to unprecedented levels during the Ukraine crisis. The UK pays market prices despite dedicated pipeline infrastructure that should provide cost advantages.

**The Hybrid Proposal:** The op-ed suggests **long-term contracts with price corridors** (caps and floors) closer to production costs, providing:
- **Price stability** for UK consumers
- **Demand certainty** for Norway as markets soften
- **Insulation from extreme volatility** while maintaining some market responsiveness

### The Strategic vs. Arbitrage Storage Model

**Two Approaches to Storage:**
1. **Strategic/Public Good Model:** Government-managed facilities providing resilience and consumer protection
2. **Arbitrage Model:** Private sector exploiting time spreads for profit

**The UK's Failure:** Private operators determined storage wasn't profitable enough under normal conditions, leading to facility closures. Yet this leaves consumers catastrophically exposed during crises.

**Kennedy's Insight:** "If the private sector is going to be the one that finances it, they're going to want to be able to kind of play the market and arbitrage away all the time spreads. But they've already told us that the margins aren't good enough to justify the capital investment."

**The Solution:** Apply the **Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model** used for nuclear projects to de-risk storage investment, potentially attracting Norway's sovereign wealth fund capital.

### The Interdependency Framework

**Mutual Vulnerability:** Both countries need each other:
- **UK:** Declining domestic production, massive import dependency, inadequate storage
- **Norway:** Tiny domestic market, export dependency, facing revenue cliff as prices soften

**The Negotiation Leverage:** This mutual need creates opportunity for a deal that:
- Provides UK with affordable, stable gas supply
- Gives Norway demand certainty and investment opportunities in UK infrastructure
- Addresses medium-term gas needs while facilitating long-term electrification

**Application Beyond Gas:** Norway's sovereign wealth fund needs investment opportunities. The UK needs capital for energy transition infrastructure. A strategic partnership could address both needs.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Markets Aren't Omnipotent - Governments Can Act

**The Conventional View:** Gas markets are liberalized, governments are powerless, nothing can change the current system.

**Kennedy's Challenge:** "If you start from the basis of governments have no power, the market is omnipotent and nothing will ever change... the broader context is like well everything's changing." He points to the Trump administration's aggressive use of institutional power to push US LNG into Europe as proof that governments absolutely can and do shape markets.

**The Historical Perspective:** The current market-based system is only 10-15 years old. The previous system of bilateral contracts and long-term deals worked for decades. There's nothing inevitable about current arrangements.

### Too Much Speculation Is Harmful

**The Industry Mantra:** "You can never have too much liquidity on a traded hub... there's no such thing as too much speculation."

**Kennedy's Analysis:** There are now **450 hedge funds actively holding TTF futures** - a five or six-fold increase since Russia's invasion. His correlation analysis shows "the relationship between the price of gas on the market hub and the change in the position of the traders is upwards of like 60-70%."

**The Implication:** "When the hedge funds move their positions in TTF futures, it moves the price of gas." These actors aren't providing liquidity for the public good - they're extracting value from the system, with costs ultimately passed to consumers.

**The Moral Dimension:** Worthington references a centuries-old bank that refuses to trade food commodities because "it pushes up the price of food and that's kind of immoral really because we need people to have more food not less." The same logic applies to energy.

### Climate Skepticism May Kill Gas Demand

**The Paradox:** The US administration's aggressive anti-climate stance may actually harm American gas exports.

**Worthington's Theory:** "Climate measures have actually driven demand for gas quite a lot... if you think Indonesia, China, large parts of India, they've got a lot of coal and the only reason they would shift off coal is if they cared about the environment."

**The Implication:** By positioning climate action as a hoax, the US may eliminate the primary reason coal-dependent countries would switch to imported gas, potentially destroying demand for American LNG.

### The Coming Glut Is Real Despite Industry Denial

**Industry Position:** Kennedy notes the gas industry is "always quite slow to acknowledge these big changes" with the mantra that "there's not going to be a glut... demand always rises, the market fixes itself."

**The Reality:** More executives are acknowledging structural oversupply, though they minimize its scale and duration. Kennedy suggests it "could be quite big and it could extend into the 2030s."

**The Unacknowledged Factor:** The industry has accepted oversupply but not yet fully acknowledged the demand destruction from electrification, which will compound the problem.

### Now Is The Time To Lock In Low Prices

**The Counterargument:** Some argue the UK should simply "sit back and enjoy the lower market pricing that is about to wash over the market and just be happy."

**Kennedy's Response:** "Isn't that a good moment to negotiate a long-term deal? If we can lock those prices in for longer, then the next time the market goes crazy, we've got a little bit of insulation around the edges."

**The Volatility Reality:** The nature of volatility is cyclical. Sunny uplands won't last forever - there will be another boom-bust cycle. Locking in favorable terms during a soft market provides protection for the inevitable next spike.

## 5. Practical Implications

### For UK Energy Policy

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Initiate bilateral negotiations with Norway** for long-term supply contracts with price corridors closer to production costs
2. **Rebalance levies** from electricity to gas to improve the economics of electrification
3. **Invest in strategic gas storage** using the RAB model to de-risk private investment
4. **Halt conversion of gas storage to hydrogen** until hydrogen economy viability is proven

**Medium-Term Strategy:**
- Recognize that UK gas demand will remain high even as domestic production declines
- Build resilience against market volatility rather than assuming markets will always provide
- Focus policy attention on the "middle bit" between immediate needs and long-term decarbonization

**Long-Term Vision:**
- Use Norwegian sovereign wealth fund capital for UK electrification infrastructure
- Create strategic energy partnership that addresses both countries' needs
- Transition from gas dependency while managing the transition period effectively

### For Norway

**The Revenue Cliff:** With gas prices potentially falling 30-60%, Norway faces losing €3-6 billion annually just from UK exports. Multiply this across all export markets for the full impact.

**Strategic Opportunity:** Rather than riding the volatility down, lock in long-term demand certainty with key partners. Trade some upside potential for downside protection and stable revenue streams.

**Investment Diversification:** The sovereign wealth fund's current strategy of owning "1% of everything" shows lack of imagination. Strategic infrastructure investments in partner countries like the UK could provide:
- Stronger bilateral relationships
- Exposure to growth sectors (electrification, storage)
- Long-term returns beyond gas export revenues

### For Understanding Energy Markets

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Market pricing doesn't equal efficient pricing** when it comes to essential commodities with geographic constraints
2. **Liberalization benefits are conditional** - they work until they catastrophically don't
3. **Storage is a public good** that markets systematically underprovide
4. **Speculation has real costs** that ultimately fall on consumers
5. **Government power matters** despite ideological claims of market omnipotence

**The Timing Question:** Energy policy operates on multiple timeframes simultaneously. The UK has been "focused on the very very near-term and the very very long term and missing the middle bit" - the 5-15 year horizon where gas dependency remains high but transition is underway.

### For Investors and Market Participants

**The Structural Shift:** A 50% increase in global LNG supply capacity is coming regardless of demand. This will fundamentally reshape pricing dynamics.

**Regional Fragmentation:** Expect continued **bifurcation between Atlantic and Asian markets**, with different pricing regimes emerging. Qatar faces east, the US faces east across the Atlantic, with the Suez Canal security issues reinforcing this split.

**The Hedge Fund Exodus:** Sophisticated traders have already "sold out of their positions" and gone "almost net short TTF because they can see the LNG wave coming." This positioning suggests they expect significantly lower prices.

**Political Risk:** Energy prices have enormous political consequences. Governments facing electoral pressure will intervene in markets. The assumption that liberalized markets are permanent is naive.

### For the Energy Transition

**The Electrification Economics:** The transition only works if electricity is affordable relative to gas. Current UK pricing (4x differential) makes this impossible for many applications.

**The Paradox of Success:** Cheaper gas due to oversupply could actually slow the transition by making fossil fuels more competitive. This requires active policy intervention, not market reliance.

**The Infrastructure Gap:** Without adequate storage and long-term supply certainty, the UK remains vulnerable to volatility that could derail transition investments. Resilience infrastructure is a prerequisite for transition, not a distraction from it.

**The Capital Requirement:** The transition requires enormous investment. Norway's sovereign wealth fund represents exactly the kind of patient, large-scale capital needed. Creating vehicles for this investment should be a priority.

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On government power vs. market ideology:**
> "If you start from the basis of governments have no power, the market is omnipotent and nothing will ever change... the broader context, the geopolitical context in which we're having this conversation is like well everything's changing. Look at the way that the Trump administration is wielding its enormous institutional power to push US LNG into southern and eastern Europe. It wouldn't be happening without that political push." - Seb Kennedy

**On the UK's storage absurdity:**
> "At a time when you, you know, it seems as if we've sort of skipped over the bit in the middle of the transition where we're still relying on gas and we've got to make sure it's affordable for consumers... we've gone straight to this kind of like, oh, hydrogen economy, which I mean, it's a bit of a figment of a gas lobbyist's wet dream." - Bryony Worthington

**On speculation in commodity markets:**
> "When the hedge funds move their positions in TTF futures, it moves the price of gas. And TTF is the benchmark that moves the price of gas all over Europe, including the UK... I just don't really buy the argument that if we were to lose 50 or 80% of the hedge funds that somehow the traded depth of the market would dry up and prices would go all volatile again." - Seb Kennedy

**On the timing for negotiation:**
> "If ever there was a time to do it, it's now because, you know, we're going to have structurally cheaper gas for the next sort of five years or so. So you have a little bit of leeway to do things like carbon pricing, to do things like putting levies on the gas portion of bills because there'll be a little bit more headroom for that." - Seb Kennedy

**On market liberalization's limits:**
> "Until Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the cumulative cost savings to consumers of buying gas on liberalized market basis was in the billions, billions of euros. But all of those savings were wiped out the day that Russia invaded Ukraine and prices went parabolic and all of that pricing was passed straight down to the retail bill of all the consumers." - Seb Kennedy

---

**Final Takeaway:** The conversation challenges the assumption that liberalized energy markets always serve consumers' interests. With structural changes creating both risks and opportunities, now is the time for governments to exercise power they've been told they don't have, renegotiating relationships and building resilience infrastructure. The UK-Norway relationship represents a specific case study, but the broader lesson applies globally: essential commodities like energy require active governance, not passive market faith. As Kennedy concludes, "Hope is not a strategy."
