# The £60 Billion Plan To Rewire Britain: Summary

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest:** John Pettigrew, outgoing CEO of National Grid (35 years with the company, 10 as CEO)

**Timing:** This interview captures Pettigrew on his "victory lap" - two months before handing over to his successor Zoe in November, making it an ideal moment for reflection on both successes and mistakes.

**Main Topic:** The unprecedented £60 billion infrastructure investment program to rewire Britain for Clean Power 2030 (CP30), the government's commitment to achieve 95% renewable electricity by 2030.

**Key Thesis:** The UK electricity grid, built in the 1960s with infrastructure concentrated in the middle of the country (generation in the north, demand in the south), must be fundamentally transformed to accommodate massive offshore wind buildout in the North Sea - requiring infrastructure on the coasts where very little currently exists.

**Company Overview:** National Grid is a transmission and distribution company operating 50/50 UK/US, with 30,000+ direct employees and double that in contractors. They transport energy from production to consumption but don't own generation. The company recently refined its strategy to focus purely on networks (transmission and distribution, electricity and gas, regulated and non-regulated, offshore and onshore).

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Unprecedented Infrastructure Challenge

**The Scale:** The £60 billion investment program (2024-2029) represents **twice the capital investment of the preceding five years**. Historically, National Grid delivered one major national transmission infrastructure project per year - they're now executing **17 simultaneously**.

**Why It's Needed:** The government's CP30 target requires moving from 15 gigawatts of operational offshore wind to **45 gigawatts by 2030**. Most of this will come from the North Sea, hitting the coast in Lincolnshire and East Anglia where transmission infrastructure is minimal. New lines must be built to demand centers like London.

**Progress Update:** Pettigrew reports they are **on track** - they wanted six of 17 projects in construction by the beginning of the fiscal year, and all six are underway. However, he characterizes the overall timeline as "hugely ambitious" with significant risks outside National Grid's control.

### Supply Chain Transformation

**The Problem:** The supply chain told National Grid they needed more transparency and certainty to deliver the required volume of work.

**The Solution:** 
- **£9 billion contract** with the supply chain for all needed skills and contractors
- **£60 billion framework agreement** for all HVDC cables
- Incentivized suppliers to deliver individually and collectively across the whole program

This represents a fundamental change in procurement and project management approach.

### The System Operator Separation

**What Happened:** In October 2024, National Grid sold the National Electricity System Operator (now called NESO - National Energy System Operator) to the UK government, completing a separation that had been debated for years.

**Division of Responsibilities:**
- **NESO's Role:** Minute-by-minute, second-by-second operation of the grid, balancing demand with generation, dispatching generators, and procuring ancillary services (voltage control, reactive power, frequency response, inertia)
- **National Grid's Role:** Building, maintaining, and developing infrastructure; connecting new generators; constructing substations and overhead lines

**Why the Split:** NESO's expanding role in advising government on policy (now covering gas, hydrogen, transport, and electricity) became inconsistent with being part of a commercial company. The separation allows NESO to play a broader strategic planning role.

### Resilience Lessons: Spain and North Hyde

**Spain Blackout (April 28):**
The Spanish grid experienced a cascading failure when:
- High levels of renewables were providing generation
- Renewables weren't providing necessary technical services (inertia)
- System oscillations caused generators to shut down to protect equipment
- This created a cascading effect leading to blackout

**Key Differences in UK:**
1. UK renewable generators have **grid code obligations** to provide ancillary services
2. NESO has spent five years developing ancillary services from third parties (e.g., batteries)

Pettigrew notes he can "never say never" about a similar event in the UK but believes these mitigations provide better protection.

**North Hyde Incident:**
Heathrow Airport went dark for longer than all of Spain and Portugal (12-14 hours vs. rapid Spanish recovery), exposing resilience weaknesses:

**What Happened:**
- A manual process from 2018 was missed
- A defect on a transformer bushing wasn't registered
- The asset failed, causing a fire that destroyed the entire substation
- An incredibly rare event (one transformer failure in 10 years, never a complete substation loss in 35 years)

**Broader Lessons:**
- National Grid wasn't aware Heathrow's private network takes 12-14 hours to switch between substations
- No single player has oversight of resilience for national critical infrastructure
- Need for more cooperation across distribution companies and beyond the sector
- Society needs to decide: What level of resilience for different types of demand? Who pays?

**The Resilience Debate:**
Pettigrew argues the UK network is 99.99999% reliable, but society may need **differentiated resilience standards** - higher for airports and military installations, standard for corner shops. Currently, every kilowatt-hour gets the same reliability standard. This is fundamentally a question of **risk versus cost**, not technology.

### The AI Data Center Surge

**What Pettigrew Got Wrong:** In 2022, he forecast low demand growth. The "one thing I definitely got wrong was forecasting low growth and demand increases from things like data centers."

**The Challenge:**
- UK has only three cities with 200 MW domestic electricity demand (London, Manchester, Birmingham)
- Data centers want to connect **1,000 MW (1 GW) in two years**
- There isn't "swathes of spare capacity" on the network (customers would have been paying for unused capacity)
- The network must be built out to meet this new demand

**The Approach:**
1. Pointing data centers to locations with spare capacity
2. Working with government to reduce planning timescales
3. **Technology solutions:** Partnership with Emerald AI (founded by Varun Sivaram) to shift non-essential data center demand away from peak periods

**The Shift:** Demand growth is now coming from **concentrated transmission-level loads** (data centers) rather than the anticipated distributed demand from heat pumps and EVs. Heat pump adoption is "significantly slower" - only 40,000 connected in three years versus forecasts of hundreds of thousands.

### Cost Implications and Market Structure

**Transmission Cost Impact:**
- National Grid currently charges **£25/year** for transmission
- Will double to **£50/year** with all the investment
- BUT will reduce constraint costs by **£40/year**
- **Net effect: minimal increase** to customer bills from infrastructure

**The Real Cost Driver:** The government's rush to CP30 is "really a bet against being exposed to those high gas prices by investing in domestic generation." The fear is repeating the Ukraine/Russia price shock.

**The Challenge:** 
- More than doubling generation capacity (offshore wind, nuclear, onshore wind, solar)
- But demand isn't doubling in the same period
- Question: How do you pay for all that capacity?

**Market Structure Debate - Zonal Pricing:**

Host Liebreich argues zonal pricing would break the link with gas (which sets electricity prices 96% of the time despite providing only 26% of electricity).

**Pettigrew's Counterargument:**
1. **Time:** NESO says implementing zonal pricing would take **5 years** - injecting massive uncertainty into investment decisions
2. **Already Decided:** Most locational decisions already made through administration (offshore wind, nuclear locations determined) - dampening zonal pricing benefits
3. **Better Alternatives:** 
   - Reform battery storage dispatch (currently charges/discharges at wrong times)
   - Increase locational charging for transmission
   - Reform how interconnectors trade across UK/Europe

**Important Caveat:** Pettigrew acknowledges "you'll never eliminate constraint costs" for three reasons:
1. Insufficient infrastructure (investment addresses this)
2. Need to balance generation with demand (with 2x capacity vs. demand on windy days, must constrain wind)
3. Ancillary services requirements (need certain generation mix in specific locations)

The question isn't eliminating constraints but **who bears the risk** - generators or socialized through other mechanisms.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Energy Trilemma Evolution

**Traditional Trilemma:** Decarbonization, Affordability, Security/Resilience

**Pettigrew's Observation:** "The trilemma has shifted massively... perhaps 3 or 4 years ago there was more focus on decarbonization and less on affordability and security of supply." Recent events (Spain blackout, North Hyde) remind people how important resilience is.

**Application:** The trilemma "doesn't really bite until you start looking at the last 5 or 10%" of decarbonization. Until then, you can genuinely be affordable, clean, AND resilient.

### Differentiated Resilience Standards

**Framework:** Not all electricity demand requires the same reliability level.

**Current State:** UK network is 99.99999% reliable, but this means occasional failures (average one hour outage every 3 years per customer).

**Proposed Approach:**
- **High resilience:** National critical infrastructure (airports, military, hospitals)
- **Standard resilience:** Residential, commercial
- **Key Questions:** What level of resilience? Who's accountable? Who pays?

**Application:** As society electrifies more (heating, transport), tolerance for outages decreases, requiring explicit decisions about resilience investments.

### The "Last Few Percent" Problem

**Liebreich's Framework:** The last 5-10% of decarbonization is "just really really hard" and "really really expensive."

**Application:** Don't make premature decisions about solving the "dunkelflaute" (dark doldrums - no wind, no sun). As long as you build **flexible gas capacity** (not inflexible baseload CCGT), you can continue with unabated gas used less and less each year.

**UK Reality:** Behind the CP30 ambition for renewables is an assumption of **35 GW of gas generation** for days when sun doesn't shine and wind doesn't blow, providing ancillary services while waiting to see how technology evolves.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Against Immediate Zonal Pricing Implementation

**Consensus View:** Many energy experts advocate for zonal pricing to break the gas price link and send locational signals to generators.

**Pettigrew's Position:** "I disagree with you that zonal pricing is the right way to do that now."

**Reasoning:**
- 5 years of implementation uncertainty would freeze investment
- Locational decisions already made administratively
- Simpler reforms can achieve similar benefits faster
- May be right "long term" but wrong for current moment

**Host's Response:** Liebreich worries UK is "on the wrong side of history" as global trend moves toward locational/zonal pricing, and no other country reports 5-year implementation timelines.

### Hydrogen and RNG Reality Check

**2022 Position:** Pettigrew was "way more optimistic about the prospects for renewable natural gas and hydrogen."

**2024 Reality:** 
- **US:** "Very little take up" of RNG; gas demand continuing to increase; need MORE gas infrastructure than anticipated; hydrogen and RNG remain "at the margins"
- **UK:** Similar lack of progress

**Contrarian Insight:** Despite policy enthusiasm for hydrogen and renewable gas, actual deployment and economics haven't materialized. Gas networks will play a longer-term role than anticipated, particularly in US Northeast.

### The Affordability vs. Speed Trade-off

**Consensus:** Rush to decarbonize as fast as possible.

**Pettigrew's Nuance:** "If you're trying to push the supply chain to deliver everything quickly, then you're going to see price increases." 

The CP30 rush is fundamentally **a bet** - accepting higher near-term costs to avoid potential future gas price shocks. Whether this is the right trade-off depends on forecasting future gas prices and potential supply shocks.

### Data Centers as Opportunity, Not Just Problem

**Common Narrative:** Data centers are a burden on the grid, competing for resources.

**Pettigrew's Frame:** "It's good for the country in terms of economic growth and it's good for us. Obviously there are customers we want to meet their needs."

**Approach:** Rather than resisting, find creative solutions (demand shifting, pointing to spare capacity locations) to accommodate what could help spread infrastructure costs across larger demand base.

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Policy and Regulation

**Planning Reform Urgency:** Planning timescales are a "big risk" for CP30. Example: The Norwich to Tilbury project (180km overhead line) just passed the hurdle to begin 18-month examination, then 2-3 years construction - extremely tight timeline.

**Resilience Strategy:** Government is developing a resilience strategy (due later in the month of recording). Key needs:
- Single oversight entity for national critical infrastructure resilience
- Clear accountability for resilience standards
- Explicit decisions about who pays for enhanced resilience

**Market Reform Priority:** Whatever reforms are pursued, the "acid test is whether we eliminate those constraint costs" - the public won't tolerate seeing wind turbines paid to not spin while gas generators are paid to run in the south.

### For Investors and Markets

**Utility Investment Thesis:** National Grid represents "mixture of growth and yields" - the 80/20 electric/gas split (100% electric UK, 50/50 US) reflects where growth opportunities lie.

**Supply Chain Opportunities:** The £9 billion supply chain contract and £60 billion cable framework represent massive opportunities, but require ability to provide transparency, certainty, and scale.

**US Northeast Gas:** Contrary to expectations, gas infrastructure investment opportunities in US Northeast are **larger and longer-term** than anticipated three years ago, driven by continued demand growth and slower renewable adoption.

**Data Center Interconnection:** Massive opportunity but requires understanding that initial 1 GW aspirations often mask nearer-term 200 MW needs - education and relationship-building critical.

### For Energy Transition Strategy

**Sequencing Matters:** Focus on the 80-90% of decarbonization that can be done affordably and reliably before obsessing over the last 5-10%. "There's just so much good interesting work to be done between now and then."

**Flexibility is Key:** Build flexible gas capacity, not inflexible baseload. This preserves optionality as technology evolves rather than locking in specific solutions for the "dunkelflaute" problem.

**Demand Growth Critical:** The only way to reduce the per-unit cost of all the infrastructure investment is **more demand** - whether from data centers, transport electrification, or heat pumps. The denominator must grow.

**Ancillary Services Underappreciated:** The Spain incident highlights that ancillary services (inertia, voltage control, frequency response) are not optional extras but essential for grid stability with high renewable penetration. These markets need development and transparency.

### For Career Planning

**Pettigrew's Message to Graduates:** "We are rewiring Britain. We're fundamentally reshaping the way that energy is going to be delivered at a time when technology is making leaps and bounds."

**Generational Opportunity:** The 1990s were about modifying an existing network; the next two decades are about **transformation** - a once-in-a-generation moment for engineers and anyone entering the energy sector.

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On the scale of change:**
> "National Grid historically has done one sort of major national transmission infrastructure project a year. We're doing 17 in the UK over the next few years. So it's a massive step up in the levels of capital investment that we need to deliver."

**On getting forecasts wrong:**
> "I was thinking back actually to when we last met and thinking how many things I got wrong in terms of what I was assuming back in 2022 compared to what's actually happened over the last 3 years... The one thing I definitely got wrong was forecasting low growth and demand increases from things like data centers."

**On the cost implications:**
> "We currently charge about £25 a year for the transmission system and it's going to double to about £50 a year with all the investment that we make. But what it will do is reduce what's called the constraint costs on the system... by £40. So actually net net for infrastructure is not a huge increase in the customer bill."

**On the government's strategy:**
> "What's driving the pace which the government wants to do this is to reduce their exposure to oil gas prices... The rush is really a bet against being exposed to those high gas prices by investing in domestic generation, albeit offshore wind and infrastructure."

**On resilience philosophy:**
> "Resilience is always incredibly expensive except in retrospect" (quoting guest Roger Dennis from earlier episode, endorsed by Pettigrew)

**On the trilemma evolution:**
> "The trilemma as we called it has shifted massively to truly a balancing act of yes people aspire to decarbonization but it has to be done in the context of delivering reliable resilient service today and it has to be affordable. Perhaps 3 or 4 years ago there was more focus on the decarbonization and less on affordability and security of supply."

**On career excitement:**
> "When I came into the industry in 1990, the network was built and we were modifying it, but we're going to be transforming it over the next decade, two decades. So it is a much more exciting time for any engineer or anybody coming into a company like National Grid."

---

**Key Takeaway:** The UK faces an unprecedented infrastructure challenge requiring double the historical investment rate to achieve Clean Power 2030, but the real complexity lies not in the engineering but in balancing speed, cost, and resilience while managing the transition's final stages where solutions remain uncertain and potentially very expensive. Success requires transformed supply chain relationships, differentiated resilience standards, market reforms that reduce constraints without creating years of uncertainty, and recognition that some decisions about the last 5-10% of decarbonization can be deferred while technology and economics evolve.
