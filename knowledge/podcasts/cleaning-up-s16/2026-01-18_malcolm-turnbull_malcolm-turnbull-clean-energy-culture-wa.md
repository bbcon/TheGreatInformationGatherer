# Malcolm Turnbull: Clean Energy Culture Wars and The Race To Build More Storage

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest Background:** Malcolm Turnbull served as Australia's Prime Minister from 2015-2018, but his career spans law, venture capital, and energy investment. He's perhaps best known internationally for his role in the 1986 Spycatcher trial in the UK. Post-politics, he founded Turnbull Renewables, developing pumped hydro and other renewable projects, and serves as President of the International Hydropower Association.

**Main Topics:** The conversation covers the geopolitical disruption under Trump, Australia's renewable energy transition, the culture wars around climate policy, and the critical role of long-duration energy storage—particularly pumped hydro versus batteries.

**Key Thesis:** Australia has moved beyond the economic debate about renewables (they're now clearly cheaper than fossil fuels), but faces critical challenges in building sufficient storage infrastructure. The main obstacles are no longer technological or economic, but political (culture wars) and structural (market design and financing mechanisms).

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### The Trump Disruption and Geopolitical Realignment

**Turnbull's Framing:** Trump represents a fundamental departure from 80 years of American foreign policy based on the rule of law and protecting the weak from the strong.

**Key Insight:** Trump's "might is right" philosophy—exemplified by his treatment of Ukraine, threats against allies, and transactional approach—forces middle powers like Australia and the UK to take more responsibility for their own security and economic arrangements.

**Nuanced Take:** Turnbull argues Trump isn't wrong about everything. European defense spending is a legitimate issue—"Why do 500 million Europeans need 350 million Americans to protect them against 140 million Russians?" His deregulation agenda also has merit, as **unnecessary environmental regulation and NIMBYism are major obstacles to renewable deployment**.

**Practical Response:** Middle powers must "band together" through arrangements like the **Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**. Turnbull personally revived this trade deal after Trump withdrew in 2017, convincing Japan's Shinzo Abe to continue without US leadership—demonstrating that multilateral cooperation can survive American withdrawal.

### Australia's Renewable Energy Revolution

**The Cultural Shift:** Turnbull emphasizes that **99% of Australians either have solar panels or know someone who does**. This creates a political reality where attacking renewables backfires—people see their own reduced electricity bills.

**Political Consequences:** The Liberal Party (center-right) suffered its worst electoral defeat in history partly because they adopted a culture war approach to climate, promoting nuclear power while attacking renewables. This messaging failed because it contradicted Australians' lived experience.

**Economic Reality:** "If you have to build a new power plant from scratch in Australia, there is no question what you're going to do—and it absolutely isn't a coal-fired power station." Liebreich notes he said this in 2012 and "it dominated the newswires for 3 days...it was practically a constitutional crisis." Now it's accepted fact.

**The Storage Challenge:** The transition's main challenge isn't generation but storage. As Turnbull explains, Australia's grid needs approximately **16 gigawatts of long-duration storage capacity with an average duration of 18 hours** to firm up renewable generation.

### The Snowy 2.0 Saga: A Case Study in Megaproject Challenges

**The Project:** Snowy 2.0 links two existing dams (Lake Tantangara and Lake Talbingo) 20km apart with 700m elevation difference, creating **350 gigawatt-hours of storage** with 2.2 GW capacity.

**The Cost Blowout Controversy:** Turnbull makes a crucial distinction about the project's budget history:
- **$2 billion:** An off-hand estimate before any feasibility study (Turnbull calls this his "worst mistake in politics")
- **$6 billion:** The actual contracted cost when the investment decision was made
- **$12 billion:** Current projected cost

"The blowout is from 6 to 12, not from 2 to 12," Turnbull insists. The $2 billion figure was like asking a builder mate for a rough guess before getting proper quotes.

**Still Worth It?** Despite doubling from the contracted price, Turnbull argues it remains economically justified because:
- On a **dollar per kilowatt-hour basis, it's still cheaper than battery alternatives** for this scale
- The enormous storage duration enables writing energy derivatives and providing grid stability
- **Batteries have dropped 50% in cost during the same period**, but can't match this duration economically

**Liebreich's Skepticism:** The challenge is that batteries now handle daily fluctuations so cheaply that Snowy 2.0 will be used relatively infrequently, making it harder to justify the capital cost. The question becomes: how do you finance something that's essential but rarely used?

### Pumped Hydro vs. Batteries: The Storage Debate

**Turnbull's Case for Pumped Hydro:**
- **Land efficiency:** A 700 MW pumped hydro project might disturb only 100 acres (for the upper reservoir), far less than equivalent solar or wind
- **Water efficiency:** Closed-loop systems recirculate water rather than consuming it
- **Proven technology:** Unlike experimental storage technologies, pumped hydro has decades of operational history
- **Complementary to batteries:** Different technologies serve different duration needs

**The "Turkey's Nest" Innovation:** Modern pumped hydro doesn't require natural geography. **Turkey's nest dams** (artificial reservoirs built on hilltops) or repurposed mine sites dramatically expand potential locations. Andrew Blakers' Global Pumped Hydro Atlas identifies **800,000 potential sites worldwide**.

**Liebreich's European Skepticism:** He questions the atlas's applicability to industrial centers like Germany and the Netherlands, which lack topography. Turnbull counters that disused mines, cross-border connections, and selective site development address this—you don't need all 800,000 sites, just enough economically viable ones.

**The Battery Advantage:** Liebreich emphasizes that **batteries are modular and can be deployed at point of use**, giving consumers control over their resilience. This distributed approach avoids transmission costs and megaproject risks. Turnbull agrees this is "a very big part" of the solution, noting Australia's massive rollout of home batteries with 30% government subsidies.

**Commercial & Industrial Opportunity:** Both agree that **commercial and industrial premises** (warehouses, logistics centers, big-box retail) represent huge untapped potential—solar on roofs with batteries behind the meter, avoiding transmission infrastructure entirely.

### The Hydrogen Detour

**Turnbull's Involvement:** He served as a non-executive director of Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest's Fortescue Future Industries and helped establish the Green Hydrogen Organization, roles he left in early 2023.

**His Current View:** "I'm not against it...I'm just not involved in it anymore." He gives Forrest "10 out of 10 for having a go" but acknowledges the challenges.

**Liebreich's Critique:** The problem isn't just energy cost—it's the entire value chain:
- **Production:** Green hydrogen requires chemical plants, not just manufacturing scale-up
- **Storage and transport:** The hydrogen molecule's physical properties make long-distance shipping prohibitively expensive
- **Learning curves:** Unlike solar or batteries, hydrogen involves multiple mature industries (chemical engineering, civil engineering) with limited cost reduction potential

**The Japan Example:** If Japan tries to use ammonia (the hydrogen carrier) for power generation, **electricity costs would increase by a factor of seven**, destroying industrial competitivity.

**Consensus Position:** Both agree hydrogen should be produced and used locally rather than shipped long distances—make it where you need it for specific industrial applications.

### Market Design and Financing Challenges

**The Core Problem:** In **energy-only markets** like Australia's, there's no clear revenue stream for standalone storage developers. The value of long-duration storage (reliability, grid stability) isn't adequately captured in wholesale electricity prices.

**Why AGL Bought Turnbull's Projects:** As a "gentailer" (generator + retailer) with 5 million customers and closing coal plants, AGL needs storage to firm its renewable generation. The integrated business model makes the economics work.

**Policy Solutions Needed:**
- **Capacity payments** or similar mechanisms
- **Revenue underwriting** for initial periods to enable debt financing
- **Government ownership** (as with Snowy 2.0)
- **Long-term electricity supply agreements** (like NSW's ELESSA scheme)

**Turnbull's Message to Policymakers:** "You've got to work out how much storage you need...then you've just got to work out what is the way that will work." Liebreich interjects: "I would say get started...do something."

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The "Technological Micawberism" Warning

Turnbull invokes Dickens' Mr. Micawber (who always said "something will turn up") to warn against **assuming future breakthroughs will solve today's problems**. 

**Application:** While Bill Gates and others focus on innovation, "we don't have the time to spare...we have every resource to meet this challenge in abundance except for time." Hope, as the Athenians told the Melians in Thucydides, "is danger's comforter."

**Practical Implication:** Deploy proven technologies (pumped hydro, batteries, wind, solar) now rather than waiting for hypothetical breakthroughs.

### The "Lazy Assumption" in Energy Modeling

Energy economist Paul Simshauser (whom Turnbull calls "the smartest energy economist I have ever met") identified a critical flaw in Australian grid modeling: **the "back/copy school of modeling"**—assuming gas peaker plants will always be available to fill gaps.

**Why It Fails:**
- Gas molecule availability is uncertain
- Pipeline infrastructure is aging and expensive to replace
- Nobody wants to invest in gas infrastructure for a fuel being phased out

**Implication:** Long-duration storage is more essential than models suggest because the gas backup assumption is unreliable.

### The Thermal Generation Replacement Fallacy

**The Insight:** Critics say renewable transition costs are enormous, but they ignore that **aging thermal plants must be replaced anyway**. Coal plants are "being held together with fencing wire" and increasingly unreliable.

**Example:** Snowy Hydro's gas peaker at Kurri Kurri has also doubled in cost, just like Snowy 2.0—supply chain inflation affects all energy infrastructure.

**Application:** Compare renewable + storage costs to the true alternative (building new thermal generation) rather than to the fictional alternative of keeping old plants running forever.

### The Culture War Trap

**Mechanism:** Right-wing politicians turned energy into a **culture war issue** despite economic reality favoring renewables. This worked temporarily but ultimately backfired.

**Why It Failed in Australia:** When 99% of people have direct positive experience with solar, telling them "renewables are terrible" contradicts their lived reality. The Liberal Party's 2022 defeat demonstrated this.

**Broader Application:** Culture war framing can override economic logic temporarily but eventually collides with material reality.

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### Pumped Hydro Isn't Dead

**Consensus View:** Many analysts see batteries as having "won" the storage race, making pumped hydro obsolete.

**Turnbull's Counter:** For **long-duration storage (8+ hours), pumped hydro remains significantly cheaper per kWh** than batteries. The technologies are complementary—batteries for daily cycling, pumped hydro for multi-day and seasonal storage.

**Supporting Evidence:** Hundreds of pumped hydro projects are under development globally. Modern designs using turkey's nest dams or disused mines overcome traditional geographic limitations.

### Trump Has Some Valid Points

**Consensus View (in progressive circles):** Trump's foreign policy is entirely destructive.

**Turnbull's Nuance:** While Trump's "might is right" philosophy abandons the rule of law, his critiques of European defense spending and American regulatory overreach have merit. **Ezra Klein's book "Abundance" makes similar points from the left** about how excessive regulation blocks renewable deployment.

**Implication:** Effective opposition to Trump requires acknowledging what he gets right while fighting what he gets wrong.

### The COP Process Needs a Reset (But Isn't Dead)

**Liebreich's History:** He declared COP dead after Copenhagen in 2009, only to see the Paris Agreement succeed in 2015. He now calls for a "climate reset" rather than declaring it dead.

**Turnbull's Position:** He's "not close enough to it any longer" to judge definitively, but focuses on industry-level action through the International Hydropower Association rather than national-level policy negotiations.

**Implication:** The COP process may be "moribund" in its current format but could be reformed rather than abandoned.

### Australia Should Welcome More Storage, Not Less

**Conventional Wisdom:** With batteries getting so cheap, Australia might be overbuilding storage.

**Turnbull's View:** "Work out how much storage you need...then add a bit." While he accepts Liebreich's correction to "just get started," he emphasizes that **"punters have a very low tolerance for the lights going out"**—better to overbuild than underbuild reliability infrastructure.

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Energy Investors

**Storage Opportunities:**
- **Behind-the-meter batteries** for commercial and industrial facilities offer immediate returns without transmission costs
- **Pumped hydro projects** near existing reservoirs with favorable geology (short distance, high head) can compete with batteries for long-duration applications
- **Integrated gentailer models** (like AGL) can monetize storage more effectively than standalone developers

**Risk Factors:**
- Megaproject cost overruns are the norm, not the exception (see Bent Flyvbjerg's research)
- **Market design determines viability**—storage projects need revenue certainty through capacity payments, contracts, or government ownership
- Technology risk is lower than execution risk for proven technologies

### For Policy Makers

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Establish clear storage targets** based on grid modeling (Australia needs ~16 GW of long-duration storage)
2. **Create financing mechanisms** that provide revenue certainty for storage developers
3. **Streamline permitting** for both batteries and pumped hydro
4. **Subsidize behind-the-meter storage** for residential and C&I customers (Australia's 30% battery subsidy is working)

**Market Design Reforms:**
- Move beyond energy-only markets to value reliability and flexibility
- Consider capacity markets or long-term contracts for storage
- Don't assume gas peakers will always be available

**Avoid:**
- Technological Micawberism—waiting for breakthrough technologies instead of deploying proven ones
- Culture war framing that contradicts citizens' lived experience
- Underestimating storage needs based on flawed modeling assumptions

### For Understanding the Energy Transition

**Key Insights:**
1. **The economic debate is over** in Australia—renewables are cheaper than new fossil generation
2. **Storage is the new frontier**—the challenge has shifted from generation to firming
3. **Distributed vs. centralized storage** will both play major roles—not either/or
4. **Political economy matters more than technology**—culture wars and market design determine deployment speed
5. **Time is the binding constraint**—we have the technology and resources but not unlimited time to deploy them

**Mental Model:** Think of the transition as moving from a small number of large, controllable generators to millions of small, variable generators. This requires:
- Massive storage (batteries + pumped hydro)
- Demand flexibility
- Sophisticated grid management
- New market structures

## 6. Notable Quotes

**On Australian renewable reality:**
> "99% of Australians either have solar panels on their roof or know somebody who does. And so to say to an Australian, 'Oh, that renewable energy is terrible and puts your costs up,' they're going to say, 'No, no, it doesn't. Actually brings my bill down. Or my mate Fred never stops boring me witless about how much money he's saving.'"

**On Trump's philosophy:**
> "Trump quite clearly believes, and not just believes but he says, that might is right...He's really transactional. He believes in strength. He believes in leverage. You know, look at that discussion he had with Zelensky in the Oval Office—'You don't have any cards'—what gangster movie did that come out of?"

**On the cost blowout controversy:**
> "The blowout is from 6 to 12, not from 2 to 12. The two was never real...It's like you've got a mate who's a builder and you say 'I want to do this' and he goes 'Oh, it'll cost you a million quid.' That's not the estimate you make your decision on."

**On time pressure:**
> "We have every resource to meet this challenge in abundance except for time. Hope is danger's comforter." (Paraphrasing Thucydides)

**On the revolution in energy:**
> "This is a complete revolution in energy. We're going from an environment where we had a relatively small number of big central thermal generators to now a situation where millions of people have got their own little power stations at home with their solar panels and their batteries."

**On skepticism vs. action:**
> "A bit of skepticism is very valuable...but you don't want to go from saying 'there's a flaw in this diamond' to 'it's a heap of junk and we'll throw it out.' You've got to be a little bit more nuanced about it."

---

**Key Tension:** The conversation reveals a productive tension between Turnbull's optimism about pumped hydro and Liebreich's skepticism about megaprojects and preference for distributed solutions. Both agree on the need for massive storage deployment but differ on the optimal mix. This reflects the broader energy transition debate: centralized vs. distributed, proven megaprojects vs. modular technologies, government-led vs. market-driven deployment.

**Bottom Line:** Australia has moved beyond debating whether to transition to renewables—the question now is how to build enough storage fast enough, and whether that storage should be centralized (pumped hydro), distributed (batteries), or both. The answer will depend less on technology than on market design, political will, and execution capability.
