# What India Gets Right About The Energy Transition | Ep226: Dr Arunabha Ghosh

## 1. Episode Overview

**Guest:** Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, founder and CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based think tank, and special envoy to COP 30 in Brazil.

**Main Topics:** India's clean energy transition, energy access expansion, manufacturing and supply chains, climate adaptation, and the future of multilateral climate cooperation.

**Key Thesis:** India is demonstrating a unique **"twin transition"** - simultaneously achieving massive-scale energy access for its population while rapidly deploying clean energy infrastructure. This approach, driven by energy security and economic growth rather than purely environmental concerns, offers important lessons for other developing nations. As Ghosh argues: *"This twin transition is not something we've seen in other major economies developed or developing."*

## 2. Major Themes Discussed

### India's Energy Access Revolution

**The Challenge:** In 2015, India had the world's largest population without electricity access.

**CEEW's Approach:** Ghosh describes conducting the world's largest energy access survey, collecting millions of household-level data points - not just whether homes had electricity, but **voltage levels, hours of supply, connection legitimacy, and pricing**. This granular data informed two major government programs.

**The Results:** Between 2017-2019, India electrified **28 million additional households (130 million people)** and provided **400 million people with access to clean cooking energy**. Electrification rates reached 98-99% by 2019.

**Key Insight:** Ghosh emphasizes this demonstrated their theory of change: *"investing in data and offering incisive analysis that is actionable down to a household level can truly impact sustainable development at scale."*

### The Renewable Energy Deployment Story

**Market Design Innovation:** India avoided the "feed-in tariff trap" that bankrupted European renewable programs. Instead, they implemented:
- **Reverse auctions** that drove prices down competitively
- **Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI)** as an intermediary between generators and utilities, reducing risk
- **State double guarantees** that lowered cost of finance
- **Must-run status** for renewables, giving them grid priority
- **Solar parks** offering plug-and-play infrastructure for investors

**The Numbers:**
- Solar costs dropped from 20 rupees/kWh (2010) to 2.5 rupees/kWh today
- Solar capacity grew from <20 MW (2010) to >100,000 MW today
- Total non-fossil capacity: 240,000 MW
- **Non-fossil capacity crossed 50% in 2025** - hitting India's 2030 target five years early
- Generation share from renewables: just above 20% (the next challenge)

**Critical Mechanism:** Reducing the **cost of capital** was essential. In developing countries, financing represents 70-80% of renewable energy tariffs. India's institutional innovations brought this down to 65-70%, making renewables competitive.

**Future Path:** If India reaches 500 GW of renewables by 2030 with moderate demand growth, **no additional coal capacity will be needed** beyond what's in the pipeline. With high demand (from cooling, AI, data centers), 600 GW would be required to eliminate new coal.

### Energy Security vs. Environmental Drivers

**The Evolution:** Ghosh traces how motivations shifted over time:
- **2008-2010:** Climate-focused (National Solar Mission launched)
- **2010-2015:** Economics-driven (falling costs, market design success)
- **2015-present:** Energy security imperative

**The Security Argument:** When you're planning for **7,000 GW of capacity for net zero**, and 6,800 GW would come from imports, that's untenable. As Ghosh explains: *"This is no longer an environmental play anymore. It is very much part of energy security."*

**The Concentration Problem:** India's renewable imports are **more concentrated than crude oil imports** - over 90% of solar panels come from China. This creates vulnerability, especially with potential dumping from overcapacity.

**Host's Counterpoint:** Worthington notes that unlike oil (consumed daily), solar panels are **one-time infrastructure investments** that generate power for decades, making import dependence less problematic.

**Ghosh's Response:** In a **high-growth economy with 20-30% generation targets**, you can't afford delays or quality issues from dumping. Unlike flat-demand economies, India doesn't have the luxury of time - delays mean continued fossil fuel buildout.

### Supply Chain Strategy: Component-Wise Comparative Advantage

**The Framework:** Rather than product-level competition (entire solar panels, wind turbines), Ghosh proposes **component-wise green comparative advantage**:
- Open up products to identify which components each country excels at
- India focuses on components where it has advantages
- China, Europe, others do the same
- Result: **diversified, interdependent supply chains** that balance domestic capacity with global trade

**Key Insight:** *"Interdependent value chains actually give everyone a stake in each other's energy security."*

**Current Gaps:** India is pursuing:
- Alternative battery chemistries (sodium-ion, not just lithium)
- Pumped hydro storage where geography permits
- Battery gigafactories
- **Critical minerals recycling** (part of India's Critical Minerals Mission)

**The Circular Economy Advantage:** Unlike fossil fuels that must be continuously replaced, metals and rare earths have high recycling rates, enabling circular economy approaches.

### Transport Electrification

**The Numbers:** India sold **1.9 million EVs** last year - not a single Tesla among them. **94% were two and three-wheelers**, with most of the remainder being buses.

**The Philosophy:** India's approach prioritizes **"transport for the vast majority"** - 60% of urban Indians still rely on walking as primary transport. This contrasts with Western focus on passenger cars.

**The Driver:** With 9 out of 10 barrels of oil imported, electrification is fundamentally about **energy security and reducing import costs** - a macroeconomic imperative.

**Biofuels Progress:** India achieved its **20% ethanol blending target** in 2024, five years ahead of schedule, and is now increasing targets further.

### Climate Adaptation and Resilience

**The Data:** CEEW is developing India's first **high-resolution climate resilience atlas** at district and sub-district level (700+ districts, 4,500+ sub-districts):
- **3/4 of districts are hotspots** for extreme climate events
- **40% of districts show "swapping trends"** - flood-prone areas becoming drought-prone and vice versa
- Rainfall intensity increasing but in shorter durations
- Severe urban flooding this summer

**The Impacts:**
1. **Agriculture:** Repeated crop failures create unsustainable fiscal burdens from farmer compensation/insurance
2. **Urban infrastructure:** Inundation slows economic activity, requiring growth forecast revisions
3. **Public health and productivity:** Broader macroeconomic effects from heat stress and extreme weather

**Heat Action Plans:** CEEW has developed heat action plans for **50 cities at neighborhood-by-neighborhood level**, aiming for 300 cities within two years. This granular approach incorporates **equity and gender lenses** for just administrative responses.

**The Urgency:** Ghosh worries about the **timing mismatch** - development will eventually make India more resilient, but extreme weather is accelerating faster than wealth-building can provide protection.

## 3. Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Twin Transition Framework

**Concept:** Simultaneous expansion of energy access AND clean energy deployment - unprecedented in major economies.

**Application:** Challenges the assumption that development must follow a "dirty then clean" pathway. Shows that with proper market design, developing nations can leapfrog to clean energy while expanding access.

### Bank of Actions vs. Bank of Commitments

**Problem:** The UNFCCC has become a "mutual admiration society" where countries announce bigger goals but face no accountability for delivery.

**Proposed Shift:** Transform the UNFCCC into a **"bank of actions"** that tracks implementation, not just commitments.

**Key Quote:** *"You could maybe trust somebody when they make a promise to you but you will trust them more when they deliver on that promise."*

**Application:** Judge climate finance roadmaps by whether they actually drive **climate investment flows** to emerging markets, not just pledge amounts.

### Climate Finance vs. Climate Investment

**Distinction:** 
- **Climate finance:** Aid, public funds, pooled resources (inherently limited)
- **Climate investment:** Commercial flows, asset replacement, growth-driven (potentially massive)

**The Math:** Required climate finance is only **2-3% of global GDP or 1% of assets under management** - the issue is deployment mechanisms, not absolute availability.

**Implication:** Environment ministers negotiating finance at COPs may be the wrong forum - need engagement with finance ministries and commercial investors.

### Strategic Bilateralism and Smart Plurilateralism

**Beyond Multilateralism:** While COPs remain important for signaling, real progress requires:
- **Strategic bilateralism:** Country-to-country collaboration on specific technologies or market designs (regardless of "annex" groupings)
- **Smart plurilateralism:** "Multi-variable geometry" where the right constellation of actors addresses specific problems
- **South-South cooperation:** Increasingly important as US retreats

**Example:** Modi-Xi meeting at Shanghai Cooperation Organization - potential for clean energy investment and technology co-development despite geopolitical tensions.

**Sectoral Applications:** Steel, cement, sustainable aviation fuels - each needs its own coalition of willing countries.

### Component-Wise Comparative Advantage

**Traditional Approach:** Countries compete to manufacture entire products (solar panels, wind turbines, batteries).

**Proposed Approach:** Identify comparative advantages at the **component level** within each product.

**Benefits:**
- Domestic industrial policy remains viable
- Supply chain diversification for energy security
- Markets stay open to international providers
- Reduces "winner-take-all" dynamics

## 4. Contrarian Takes

### COPs Are Becoming Less Relevant for Actual Progress

**Worthington's Skepticism:** Post-Paris, there's little actual negotiation happening - just voluntary commitments and sectoral pledges. Environment ministers discussing finance isn't optimal.

**Ghosh's Nuanced Agreement:** It's "more than signaling" but agrees much work must happen outside COPs. The world of 2025 is fundamentally different from 2015 - meteorologically, geopolitically, economically, socially.

**The Real Work:** Happens through:
- Domestic market transformations
- Strategic bilateral partnerships
- Plurilateral sectoral initiatives
- These then feed back to COPs for monitoring and spotlight

**Remaining COP Value:** Shining a spotlight on who delivers vs. who doesn't - "a necessary moral and instrumental imperative."

### Climate Leadership Isn't a Crown Worn by One Head

**The Critique:** We've done ourselves a disservice assuming climate leadership comes only from traditional powers (US, EU).

**The Reality:** Significant action is happening in the Global South:
- **Vietnam:** Largest renewable deployment in Southeast Asia (not the largest economy)
- **Uruguay:** Leading in South America
- **Namibia:** Emerging African leader
- **India and China:** Categories of their own

**Implication:** Need to recognize and learn from diverse approaches rather than waiting for traditional leaders.

### The "Just Import Renewables" Argument Doesn't Work for Growing Economies

**Common Argument:** Solar panels are one-time purchases that generate power for decades, unlike oil that must be continuously bought - so import dependence is less problematic.

**Ghosh's Counter:** This works for **flat-demand economies** with time flexibility. For high-growth economies:
- Any supply delay means continued fossil fuel buildout
- Quality issues from dumped products undermine grid reliability
- Scale of deployment (7,000 GW for net zero) makes 95%+ import dependence untenable
- Grid operators won't risk downtime - they'll choose fossil fuels if renewables are unreliable

**The Balance:** Not about making everything domestically (protectionism) but ensuring **sufficient diversification** for energy security while maintaining open markets.

### Climate Change Is No Longer "High Politics"

**The Paradox:** Climate change is a more severe crisis in 2025 than 2015, yet it's **dropped from high political priority** in many countries.

**Why It Matters:** Without high-level political attention, you don't get:
- Cross-ministerial coordination
- Finance ministry engagement
- Trade policy alignment
- Infrastructure planning integration

**Who Still Treats It as High Politics:** Emerging economies building infrastructure that must be resilient against storms, floods, heat - because it's essential for maintaining **economic dynamism**.

**The Opportunity:** These countries may drive progress precisely because climate resilience is integral to their growth agenda, not separate from it.

### Geoengineering Research Should Happen Transparently Now

**The Uncomfortable Reality:** If temperature increases accelerate and impacts worsen, there will be **political pressure for rapid intervention** - potentially without proper research or governance.

**The Moral Imperative:** Worthington argues it would be "immoral not to explore" these technologies, given the potential need to "buy time" for adaptation and mitigation.

**Ghosh's Conditions for Research:**
- **Transparency** (not university-level jurisdiction for planetary-scale technologies)
- **Clear thresholds** before field testing
- **International collaboration** (public funding with parliamentary oversight better than self-regulating scientists)
- **Inclusive research programs** involving countries/communities most likely to be impacted

**Current Role:** Ghosh serves on UK's ARIA oversight committee for cooling intervention research, ensuring it follows these principles.

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Policymakers in Developing Countries

**Market Design Matters More Than Technology:**
- Reverse auctions beat feed-in tariffs for fiscal sustainability
- Intermediary institutions (like SECI) can de-risk investments
- Must-run status accelerates deployment
- Solar parks reduce land acquisition barriers

**Data Infrastructure Is Essential:**
- Household-level granular data enables targeted programs
- Independent validation builds credibility
- Continuous surveying tracks progress and identifies gaps

**Sequence Matters:**
- Unbundle generation, transmission, distribution
- Enable private sector in generation first
- Build grid capacity in parallel with renewable deployment (not sequentially)
- Plan for storage from the start

**Competitive Federalism:**
- Let states specialize (Rajasthan-solar, Tamil Nadu-wind, others-batteries, hydrogen)
- Creates localized political economy for green transition
- Enables experimentation and learning

### For International Investors

**Where India Offers Opportunities:**
- Solar parks with plug-and-play infrastructure
- Battery manufacturing (various chemistries)
- Green hydrogen valleys
- Clean transport (two/three-wheelers, buses)
- Minerals recycling

**Risk Mitigation Mechanisms:**
- Intermediary institutions separating generators from utilities
- State guarantees reducing cost of capital
- Stable policy frameworks (20+ years of power market reforms)
- Growing domestic demand (not export-dependent)

**The Scale:** $50 billion invested last year, but bulk must come domestically to avoid exchange rate appreciation affecting export competitiveness.

### For Climate Negotiators

**Shift Focus to Implementation:**
- Track delivery on existing commitments
- Create accountability mechanisms (even if just "shining a spotlight")
- Design finance mechanisms that unlock investment, not just aid

**Embrace Variable Geometry:**
- Don't wait for universal agreements
- Form sectoral coalitions (steel, cement, aviation fuels)
- Enable bilateral partnerships across traditional groupings
- South-South cooperation increasingly important

**Recognize Diverse Leadership:**
- Learn from Global South innovations
- Share market design lessons
- Build bridges rather than reinforcing North-South divisions

### For Understanding Energy Security

**The New Paradigm:**
- Energy security now includes **supply chain resilience** for clean energy components
- Concentration risk in renewables can exceed fossil fuel concentration
- **Interdependent value chains** create mutual stakes in security

**The Cascading Benefits of Electrification:**
- More efficient energy use (deflationary)
- Frees up molecules (e.g., ethanol) for hard-to-abate sectors
- Enables circular economy for materials
- Reduces import dependence for oil-importing nations

**Practical Example:** Brazil's ethanol production for domestic transport exceeds China's total aviation fuel demand - electrifying Brazil's transport could free ethanol for Chinese aviation, creating win-win trade.

### For Climate Adaptation

**Hyper-Local Assessment Is Critical:**
- National or regional data insufficient for effective response
- Need district and sub-district level risk mapping
- Incorporate equity and gender lenses
- Enable neighborhood-specific interventions

**The Fiscal Imperative:**
- Repeated disaster compensation unsustainable
- Proactive resilience investment cheaper than reactive relief
- Infrastructure planning must integrate climate projections

**International Collaboration Needed:**
- Global South regions often treated as "one big pixel" in models
- Need international research programs for hyper-local risk assessment
- This is "high politics" for emerging economies even if not for developed ones

## 6. Notable Quotes

1. **On India's unique transition:** *"Rapid and massive scale access to energy happening concurrently with a huge injection of clean energy. This twin transition is not something we've seen in other major economies developed or developing."*

2. **On trust and accountability:** *"You could maybe trust somebody when they make a promise to you but you will trust them more when they deliver on that promise... the UNFCCC should start imagining itself as a bank of actions rather than a bank of commitments."*

3. **On energy security evolution:** *"This is no longer an environmental play anymore. It is very much part of energy security... When you're planning for 7,000 GW of capacity for net zero, and 6,800 GW would come from somewhere else, it's going to be very hard to sell that narrative to any policy maker."*

4. **On the value of data:** *"Our theory of change of investing in data and offering incisive analysis that is actionable down to a household level can truly impact sustainable development at scale."*

5. **On climate's political status:** *"Climate change is no longer high politics. That is the real challenge that we are faced with. And yet it is a more severe crisis in 2025 than it was in 2015."*

---

**Key Takeaway:** India's clean energy transition offers a replicable model for developing nations - one driven by energy security and economic growth rather than purely environmental concerns, enabled by innovative market design and institutional frameworks, and demonstrating that energy access expansion and decarbonization can happen simultaneously rather than sequentially. The challenge now is implementation at scale while building resilience to accelerating climate impacts.
