## Market Dynamics & Analysis

**Fed Independence Concerns:**
The unprecedented move by the Department of Justice to issue criminal subpoenas to FOMC members represents a significant escalation in political pressure on the Federal Reserve. Historically, central bank independence has been viewed as critical for effective monetary policy, and any perceived threats to this independence typically generate market volatility and concern.

**Financial Sector Under Pressure:**
The proposed 10% credit card rate cap would potentially impact billions in revenue for major card issuers. Credit card interest income is a significant profit driver for banks, and regulatory restrictions could force business model adjustments.

**Rotation Trade Intact:**
The continued outperformance of small-caps and cyclicals suggests investors are increasingly confident in:
- Broader economic strength beyond tech
- Potential for mean reversion after years of mega-cap dominance
- Improving earnings prospects for smaller companies

**Tech Milestone:**
Alphabet's $4 trillion market cap achievement demonstrates that despite rotation concerns, the largest tech companies continue to grow and attract capital based on strong fundamentals and AI positioning.
