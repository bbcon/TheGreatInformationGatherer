## About

Every day, hours of market commentary, dozens of data releases, and countless expert opinions compete for your attention. Most of it is noise. Buried in that noise are the developments that actually matter: the data points moving markets, the policy shifts reshaping portfolios, the cross-asset signals worth watching.

**The Daily Macro & Market Brief** extracts what matters and delivers it in a format you can read in 5 minutes.

## How to Use This

**Before your morning meetings**: Read the daily brief to know what happened overnight and what's driving markets. You'll be the person who knows the numbers.

**For idea generation**: The weekly synthesis helps identify emerging themes before they become consensus trades. Track how narratives evolve across multiple days.

**To stay sharp**: Even if you're not in markets, understanding macro makes you better at your job—whether that's strategy, consulting, policy, or business leadership. Economic literacy compounds.

**As a forcing function**: Following markets daily builds pattern recognition. You start noticing when reactions don't match the news, when positioning is stretched, when the narrative is about to shift.

## What This Can Do for Your Career

Markets reward those who do the work to understand what's actually happening. Most people skim headlines. Few systematically track the data, the policy signals, the cross-asset moves.

This brief gives you an edge:
- **In conversations**: Reference specific data points and developments, not vague sentiment
- **In analysis**: Build on a foundation of facts rather than starting from scratch
- **In judgment**: Develop intuition for how markets process information
- **In credibility**: Be the person who actually knows what happened and why

Whether you're in finance, macro research, policy, consulting, or just intellectually curious about how the world works—consistent, systematic attention to what matters pays dividends.

## Who's Behind This

I work in macro at a hedge fund. My job requires synthesizing vast amounts of information—economic data, central bank communications, market moves, geopolitical developments—into coherent views.

The challenge: there's too much information and too little time. Keeping up with everything that matters is a full-time job on top of your actual job.

This newsletter solves that problem for you. Every day, I cut through the noise so you don't have to. No paywalls (for now). No affiliate links. No positions to pump. Just the macro story, clearly told.

## Why Trust This?

I'm not selling you anything. I'm not talking my book publicly. I have no incentive to mislead.

I'm a practitioner who needs to understand macro to do my job—and the best way to sharpen thinking is to synthesize and explain. If the analysis is useful, subscribe. If it's not, don't.
