00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:09.342
IN &gt;&gt; THE NEXT BULLISH
CATALYST, THE EARNINGS SEASON.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:13.279
&gt;&gt; THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS
REALLY ABOUT EARNINGS

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.414 line:92%
REALIZATION.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.417
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A MOMENT OF PAUSE
THAT MAYBE 2026 IS NOT GOING TO

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.420
BE AS SMOOTH AS A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE ANTICIPATING.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.423
&gt;&gt; THERE IS STILL ROOM TO RUN
HERE.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.293
&gt;&gt; THIS IS "BLOOMBERG
SURVEILLANCE." JONATHAN:

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:35.068
LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS
MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.404
MORNING.
"BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE."

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:41.408
PULLING BACK FROM A RECORD, THE
EQUITY MARKET RALLY STALLING AS

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.410
PRECIOUS METALS HIT ALL-TIME
HIGHS WHILE INVESTORS ARE

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.413
WAITING FOR BANK EARNINGS ON
WALL STREET AND A POSSIBLE

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.415
SUPREME COURT OPINION ON THE
PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.418
A STACKED WEDNESDAY COMING UP.
ANNMARIE:

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:56.423
THANKS HAVE TO BE IN FOCUS.
NOT EVEN SO MUCH HOW PROFITABLE

00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:02.429
THESE WALL STREET BANKS ARE AND
HOW WELL THEY ARE WEATHERING

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.396
SOME OF THE STORMS. IT IS ABOUT
THE POPULIST POLICIES COMING

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.402
OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.
THE SECOND QUESTION -- THE

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.403
FIRST QUESTION WAS ABOUT FED
INDEPENDENCE OR CREDIT CARDS TO

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:15.408
J.P. MORGAN YESTERDAY, AND THEY
CANNOT IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.410
YOU GET THIS 10% CAP.
HOW CHALLENGING IS THAT GOING

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.415
TO BE ON THE EARNINGS CALL
TODAY? JONATHAN:

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.417
WHAT IS IT ABOUT J.P.
MORGAN EARNINGS AND THE C-SUITE

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:28.822
THAT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THE
EARNINGS, WE END UP TALKING

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:32.425
ABOUT OTHER THINGS? ANNMARIE:
IT IS ALMOST SELF-INFLICTED.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.428
ALSO YOU HAVE TO THINK THE
CREDIT CARD DRAMA RIGHT NOW --

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:39.599
WHICH, BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT
LAW. THIS MAY NEVER BECOME LAW.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.836
THIS WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR
BY SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS AND

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.405
SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY.
CONGRESS WOULD NEED TO ENACT

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:51.411 line:92%
THIS.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.413
BUT THIS REMINDS ME OF THE
THIRD QUARTER, WHERE

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.416
COCKROACHES BECAME THE ENTIRE
BUZZ WORD OF THE EARNINGS

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.417
SEASON FOR THESE BANKS BECAUSE
JAMIE DIMON SAID WHEN THERE IS

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.420
ONE COCKROACH THERE MAY BE
ANOTHER.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.424
NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CREDIT
CARDS. JONATHAN:

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.427
THE HEADLINES ABOUT WHITE HOUSE
POLICY.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:11.397
WE WILL HEAR FROM BANK OF
AMERICA.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:16.402
WE WILL HEAR FROM WELLS FARGO.
LATER ON WE WILL HEAR FROM CITI.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:20.406
LATER TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM
THE SUPREME COURT.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.407
THE SUPREME COURT OPINIONS AND
THE POTENTIAL THAT THEY RULE ON

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.610 line:92%
THOSE LIBERATION DAY TARIFFS.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.413
ANNMARIE:
THE SUPREME COURT HAS TOLD US

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.414
THEY WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPINION
DAY.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.417
THIS IS THE SECOND OPINION DAY
OF THE YEAR.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.418
POTENTIALLY WE WILL GET THAT
DECISION, AND THE PRESIDENT WAS

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:35.021
IN DETROIT YESTERDAY.
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:39.459
HE SAID, CAN YOU BELIEVE THE
SUPREME COURT IS TRYING TO GO

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.428
AFTER MY TARIFFS?
SAID THE LAWSUITS ARE COMING

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:46.399
FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO
COZY UP TO CHINA AND THEY ARE

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.401
PART OF THE FOREIGN
POLICY-CENTRIC CROWD.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.404
WHAT HE DID SAY SOMETHING
INTERESTING.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:55.408
"WE WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT
IF WE DON'T WIN."

00:02:55.408 --> 00:03:00.413
TARIFFS ARE HERE TO STAY.
JONATHAN:

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.283
A COUPLE OF THINGS REGARDING
TARIFFS.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:07.120
ONE WAS TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE
CHINESE.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.424
CHECK OUT THESE NUMBERS.
EXPORTS TO THE U.S.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.425
DROPPED 20% FROM CHINA IN 2025,
YET STILL CHINA PUT UP A RECORD

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:18.398
TRADE SURPLUS. ANNMARIE:
BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO LATIN

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.400
AMERICA, THEY'RE GOING TO THE
EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH IS GOING

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.405
TO HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM AS YOU
SEE THE INDUSTRY HOLLOW OUT.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.409
I THOUGHT THIS WAS RICH.
THE FINANCIAL TIMES CAUGHT THIS.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.411
THE VICE MINISTER OF THE
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:36.416
CUSTOMS OF CHINA BLAMED THE
UNITED STATES.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.418
IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT
SOME COUNTRIES' POLITICS

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:44.424 line:92%
REGARDING ECONOMIC AND TRADE

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:49.429
ISSUES, USING VARIOUS PRETEXTS
TO RESTRICT IMPORTS FROM CHINA

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.399
-- BASICALLY, BLAMING THEIR
RECORD RISE OF EXPORTS ON THE

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:59.405
U.S. JONATHAN:
DO NOT MISS LISA'S CONVERSATION

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.407
WITH THE DELTA AIRLINES CEO.
WE WILL CATCH UP WITH LISA

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:05.478
LATER THIS MORNING.
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:11.251
EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&amp;P
POINTING TOWARD ANOTHER DAY OF

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.418 line:92%
LOSSES.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:16.422
COMING UP THIS HOUR, WE WILL
CATCH UP WITH AARON KENNON OF

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:21.427
CLEAR HARBOR, ED MILLS OF
RAYMOND JAMES, AND CHRIS

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:22.428
MARINAC OF JANNEY MONTGOMERY
SCOTT WITH BIG BANK EARNINGS IN

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.397
FULL SWING.
WE BEGIN WITH STOCKS PULLING

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:30.403 line:92%
BACK.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.405
AARON KENNON WRITING, MARKETS
HAVE LIKELY PULLED FORWARD SOME

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.407
FUTURE RETURNS WHILE U.S.
EXCEPTIONALISM SHOULD PERSIST.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:39.412
VALUATIONS STILL MATTER.
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:44.417
LET'S PICK UP ON THOSE BANK
EARNINGS. WHAT WAS THE LESSON?

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.419
WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM WHAT WE
HEARD FROM J.P.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.421
MORGAN AND WHAT WE SAW IN THE
STOCK PRICE REACTION? AARON:

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:52.425
I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING.
WHAT WE HEARD WAS THAT SALES

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.428
AND TRADING WAS ACTIVE.
AND UNDERWRITING WAS A LITTLE

00:04:55.428 --> 00:05:06.406 line:92%
WEAK. IT WAS A FOURTH QUARTER.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:13.413
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF WE
SEE THIS PULL FORWARD INTO Q1.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:17.417
LATE INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER WE
COULD SEE A LITTLE LESS TEMPO

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:21.421
TO THE CADENCE OF M&amp;A ACTIVITY,
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET, J.P.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:27.427
MORGAN STOCK IS NOT CHEAP.
IT IS A GREAT BANK, BUT IT IS

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.429
TRADING AT NOSEBLEED MULTIPLES
TO TANGIBLES BOOK.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.396
EVEN THE C-SUITE KNOWS THAT,
WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE NOT

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.398
BUYING BACK THEIR STOCK.
JONATHAN:

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:38.404
LET'S STAY ON THE STOCK STORY.
CAN YOU GIVE THOSE POCKETS OF

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:43.409
WEAKNESS A PASS WHEN THE STOCK
IS SO RICHLY VALUED? MOHAMED:

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.412
I THINK SO.
I THINK IF YOU LOOK LONGER THE

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:52.418
STORY FOR THE BANKS, BOTH J.P.
MORGAN AND OTHER MEGABANKS IN

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:55.421
THE U.S., IS STRONG.
I THINK THEY HAVE A REACH NOT

00:05:55.421 --> 00:06:00.226
JUST TO THE U.S.
CONSUMER, BUT TO EMERGING

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:01.427 line:92%
MARKETS.

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:04.397
ANNMARIE POINTED OUT THAT THE
CHINA TREE -- TRADE TRENDS.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:06.399
THE LIKES OF J.P.
MORGAN ARE ACTIVE IN THOSE

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:11.404
REGIONS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE-CLASS

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:15.408
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BETWEEN CHINA
AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FROM A

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:18.411
BANKING PERSPECTIVE BETWEEN THE
U.S.

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.413
BANKS AND SOME OF THESE AREAS
OF REAL GLOBAL GROWTH GOING

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:24.417
FORWARD I THINK THEY ARE
REASONABLY WELL-POSITION.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.420
JONATHAN:
ANNMARIE ALSO MENTIONED THE

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.623
BIGGEST STORIES.
IT WAS THE PUSHBACK ON THE

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:34.627
EARNINGS CALL AND THIS POPULIST
TWIST DOMINATING THE EARLY PART

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.397
OF 2026.
HOW WAS THAT INFLUENCING YOUR

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.402
APPROACH TO ALLOCATING CAPITAL
FOR THE YEAR AHEAD? MOHAMED:

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.405
-- AARON:
IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE THE

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:50.410
STOCK MARKET IS REACTING TO NOT
JUST FINANCIALS, THEY ARE

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.412
REACTING NEGATIVELY TO THIS
NEWS, AND IT DOES REQUIRE AN

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:56.416
ACT OF CONGRESS.
IT IS THE MARKET READING THE

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.420
TEA LEAVES AND THINKING THAT
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.422
ABLE TO NUDGE CONGRESS INTO
VOTING FOR THIS, BECAUSE IT

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:07.427
DOES REPRESENT A GOOD DOSE OF
POPULISM. PERHAPS.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.429
I AM A BIT SKEPTICAL THIS WILL
BECOME A REALITY FROM THE

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:17.403
STANDPOINT OF LAW.
IN REALITY IF YOU WERE TO MOVE

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.405
THE PRIME RATE FROM 20%,
AVERAGE CREDIT CARD RATES ARE

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:22.408
20% DOWN TO 10.
I THINK THE ONLY THING IT DOES

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:25.278
IS HURT THE CONSUMERS HE IS
TRYING TO ATTRACT TO VOTE FOR

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.413
REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERMS.
BECAUSE THEY WILL LOSE THEIR

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:31.417
LINES OF CREDIT. ANNMARIE:
I'M WITH YOU ON, THIS IS

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:35.321
HALF-BAKED.
IT IS JUST A TRUTH SOCIAL ABOUT

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:40.526
THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE INTEREST RATES CAPPED ON

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:44.063
CREDIT CARDS.
HAVE TO -- IT HAS TO GO THROUGH

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:48.034
CONGRESS AND THERE HAVE BEEN
BILLS FLOATING THAT THE SENATE

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.403 line:92%
AND HOUSE HAVE NOT TAKEN UP.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:53.406
WHY DOES THE MARKET REACT TO
TRUTHS AND NOT WHEN IT IS A

00:07:53.406 --> 00:08:00.413
LEGAL FRAMEWORK SIGNED INTO LAW?
AARON:

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:03.416
IF HE SOMEHOW DECLARES A
NATIONAL EMERGENCY MAYBE THERE

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.419
IS A PERIOD OF A FEW MONTHS
WHERE THIS HAS TO WORK ITS WAY

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:11.424
THROUGH THE COURTS TO THEN MAKE
THE CASE THAT THIS IS NOT IN

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:14.227
THE PURVIEW OF THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH AND REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.429
ACTION.
MAYBE THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:21.400
THAT, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.
ANNMARIE:

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.401
THE MARKET HAS SHRUGGED OFF FED
INDEPENDENCE FOR THE MOST PART.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:29.408 line:92%
WHY IS THAT? AARON:

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:35.414
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY
THE FED HAS A GROUP OF VOTING

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:37.416
NUMBERS AROUND HIM THAT I
BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT THEY

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:43.422
AGREE WITH HIM OR NOT BELIEVE
THAT HE IS LOOKING AT THE DATA

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:48.427
AS HE SEES IT AND TRYING TO
MAKE THE BEST CASE FOR HIS VIEW

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.397
ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:55.401
I THINK IT IS A SAD DAY WHEN
YOU HAVE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

00:08:55.401 --> 00:09:01.407
OF GOVERNMENT SUGGESTING THAT
JUST BECAUSE A FEDERAL RESERVE,

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:05.411
FOMC COMMITTEE -- OF COURSE, HE
IS ONLY ONE VOTE, IS MOVING

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:09.415
RATES LOWER, BUT NOT QUICKLY
ENOUGH.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:13.419
WE DID SEE A 100 BASIS POINT
CUT IN 2024.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:16.422
THAT IS NOT FAST ENOUGH, SO
MAYBE HE IS A CRIMINAL AND WE

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:20.426
HAVE TO PUT HIM BEHIND BARS AND
WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS SILLY

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:25.498
IDEA THAT THERE IS A COST
OVERRUN AT THE FED RENOVATION

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.399 line:92%
FOR THIS.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:30.403
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE -- IT
SEEMS BELOW US AS A COUNTRY.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.406
I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AND
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL PASS.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.407
JONATHAN:
TRACKING THE STORY OVER THE

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.409
LAST 12 MONTHS I UNDERSTAND THE
IMPORTANCE OF IT.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:42.415
I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN.
BUT CHECK OUT THE BOND MARKET.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:51.424
TENDS AT 4.15% THIS MORNING.
INCREDIBLY RANGE BOUND.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.426
WE OPENED UP THIS MORNING ABOUT
THESE RECORD HIGHS IN PRECIOUS

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.094
METALS.
WHAT CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.964
EXPLAINS SOME OF THE ALL-TIME
HIGHS WE ARE SEEING IN PRECIOUS

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.398 line:92%
METALS? AND IS VERY COOL, CALM,

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.100
COLLECTED BOND MARKET THAT HAS
DOMINATED THE LAST SEVERAL

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.401
MONTHS? AARON:
I THINK INVESTORS ARE KEEPING

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:08.407
THEIR EYE ON THE BALL.
WHAT IS THAT BALL?

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:11.410
THE BALL IS THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL
BILL IS GOING TO START TO

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.413
FUNNEL SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS
INTO THE ECONOMY ON THE PART OF

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:18.417
THE CONSUMER AS OF JANUARY 1.
WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SEE

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:22.421
ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ON THE
INDUSTRIAL SIDE.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:25.424
THAT IS A HUGE POTENTIAL GROWTH
CATALYST. I THINK WITH THE

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:26.425
MARKET IS TELLING US, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE METALS SIDE, IT IS

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:33.399
NOT JUST GOLD.
IT IS ALUMINUM, IT IS PLATINUM.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:36.402
STARTING INTO THE INDUSTRIAL
SIDE OF THINGS, MID SINGLE

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:40.406
DIGITS ALREADY THIS YEAR, OR
DOUBLE DIGITS IN SOME CASES.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.409
THIS IS A GROWTH STORY.
WE HAVE GONE FROM A PERIOD

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.411
WHERE THE LAST SUPER CYCLE IN
COMMODITIES WAS ONE BASED ON

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.414
GLOBALIZATION, THE DEMAND SIDE.
NOW WE ARE IN THIS PERIOD OF

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:54.420
FRAGMENTATION.
WE ARE NOTICING FOR NATIONAL

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.426
SECURITY PURPOSES AND OTHER
REASONS THAT THAT FRAGMENTATION

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:04.397
BEHOOVES US TO ENSURE THAT WE
HAVE METALS THAT ARE REQUIRED

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:08.401
TO BUILD MUSCLES -- MISSILES,
METALS REQUIRED TO BUILD OUT AI

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.404
AT HOME AND WITH OUR ALLIES,
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:16.409
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THIS
SUPER CYCLE RESTART AGAIN.

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.410
JONATHAN:
WE SAW AT THROUGHOUT THE LAST

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.412
YEAR AS WELL.
GOLD WAS HIGHER LAST YEAR, AS

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:24.417
YOU POINTED OUT.
HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:31.424
PLAYING THIS STORY THROUGH 2026?
AARON:

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.426
I THINK THE METALS STORY HAS
LEGS.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:37.396
I THINK THE GOLD STORY HAS LEGS
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.398
GOLD IS, I BELIEVE, JUST
ANOTHER CURRENCY.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:45.404
IT IS JUST NOT A FIAT CURRENCY.
IF YOU LOOK AT CENTRAL BANK

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:47.406
BUYING OUTSIDE THE UNITED
STATES, PARTICULARLY AMONG

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:51.410
ENTITIES NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH
US -- RUSSIA, CHINA, AND OTHERS

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.412
-- THEIR NET GOLD PURCHASES
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:11:53.412 --> 00:12:00.419
HAS SKYROCKETED.
IF YOU LOOK AT FOREIGN RESERVES

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.421
OF GOLD FROM JUST 20 TODAY HAS
GONE FROM 6% TO 22% OF CENTRAL

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:09.428
BANK FOREIGN RESERVES.
I THINK THAT BID CONTINUES.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:12.398
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY IT
WOULDN'T, AND OF CHINA IS

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.401
TRADING LESS WITH THE UNITED
STATES AND DOING MORE BUSINESS

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:21.407
WITH LATIN AMERICA AND EMERGING
MARKETS I THINK THAT IS A CASE

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.408
FOR THEM TO BE DOING TRADE IN
THOSE COUNTRIES, RECEIVING THAT

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:28.414
CURRENCY, AND PUTTING IT INTO
GOLD RESERVES. JONATHAN:

CRITICISM OVER THE DOJ PROBE

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.411
THE PRESIDENT SAYING JAMIE
DIMON WAS WRONG TO SUGGEST HE

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.412
WAS UNDERMINING THE
INDEPENDENCE OF THE CENTRAL

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:03.415

THE PRESIDENT SANK, "I THINK IT

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:10.422

WE HAVE A BAD FOR PERSON."

THE PRESIDENT ALSO WEIGHING IN

I THINK IT'S FINE WHAT I AM

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.412
HE WAS EXTENDED BY BIDEN AND I
THINK HE IS WRONG.

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:11.417
HE HAS DONE A BAD JOB.
WE SHOULD HAVE LOWER RATES.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.418
JAMIE DIMON WANTS HIGHER RATES.
MAYBE IT MAKES MORE MONEY THAT

ON JAMIE DIMON. PRES. TRUMP:
I THINK IT'S FINE WHAT I'M

YEAH, I THINK HE IS WRONG.
HE HAS DONE A BAD JOB.

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:28.527
WE SHOULD HAVE LOWER RATES.
JAMIE DIMON PROBABLY WANTS

HIGHER RATES.
MAYBE HE MAKES MORE MONEY THAT

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:38.537

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:41.540
SUGGESTION THAT HIS PROBE INTO
THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL HAVE

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.511
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ECONOMY.
JOINING US IS TYLER KENDALL.

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:49.515
CERTAINLY A BIG FEATURE OF THE
NEWS FLOW IN THE LAST DAY OR SO.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.518
TYLER:
THIS IS THE LATEST FRICTION

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.520
POINT BETWEEN WALL STREET AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE WEEK

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.523
WHERE WE HAVE SEEN ATTACKS ON
THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BUT ALSO

00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:01.527
POLICY PROPOSALS THAT BIG BANKS
DON'T LIKE.

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:04.530
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PUSHBACK IS
ALSO NOTABLE BECAUSE AT FIRST

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.533
THIS WHITE HOUSE APPEARED TO
TRY TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THE

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.535
INVESTIGATION.
THE PRESS SECRETARY SAYING

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:13.539
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT HAVE
KNOWLEDGE OF NOR ORDERED IT,

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:15.541
BUT NOW IT APPEARS THE
PRESIDENT IS THROWING HIS

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.510
SUPPORT BEHIND IT AND ALSO WENT
ON TO TELL REPORTERS THAT HE

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.513
DOES INTEND TO PUSH AHEAD WITH
PLANS TO NAME HIS PICK TO LEAD

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:24.516
THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE NEXT
FEW WEEKS.

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:31.523 line:92%
DESPITE THIS INVESTIGATION

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:32.524
POSING POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:37.529
IN MICHIGAN AND WENT ON TO
DEFEND HIS IDEA TO CAP INTEREST

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.533
RATES AND ALSO DOUBLED DOWN ON
HIS CALL FOR LEGISLATION THAT

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:42.534
WOULD CRACKDOWN ON CREDIT CARD
SWIPE FEES.

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:47.539
THIS ON THE HEEL OF BLOOMBERG
NEWS REPORTING THAT BIG INK

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.542
EXECUTIVES ARE CONSIDERING SOME
POTENTIAL OPTIONS COULD PUT ON

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:53.512
THE TABLE AND PRESENT TO THE
ADMINISTRATION IN A BID TO GET

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.514
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BACK OFF
SOME OF THESE IDEAS AHEAD OF

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.517
WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A
MASSIVE LOBBYING CAMPAIGN ON

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:03.422
CAPITOL HILL AGAINST THEM.
THOUGH IT MAY NOT GET TO THAT.

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:07.426
HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON AND
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER JOHN

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:10.529
THUNE.
TO THROW COLD WATER OVER THE

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.531
CREDIT CARD CAP INTEREST RATE
PROPOSALS, CITING CONCERNS THAT

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:17.536
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS COULD BE
AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR CREDIT.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:21.540
I WILL POINT OUT JOHN THUNE
ALSO SAID HE DOES THINK THE

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.542
CREDIT CARD COMPETITION ACT,
THAT BIPARTISAN BILL THAT WOULD

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:29.515
TAKE AIM AT SWIPE FEES WILL GET
A VOTE. AS REPUBLICANS GO ON THE

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:34.520
DEFENSE OVER COST-OF-LIVING
ISSUES. JONATHAN:

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.521
THE STORY IS NOT GOING AWAY.
TYLER KENDALL DOWN IN

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:40.526
WASHINGTON.
IN ANOTHER WORLD I WOULD SAY

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:42.528
THE PRESIDENT IS UNFORTUNATELY
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE POLICIES

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:47.533
THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED BY
THE WHITE HOUSE WANTING YOU ARE

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:51.537
HEARING IS AGREED BY A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN WALL STREET THAT

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:54.540
THESE KIND OF POLICY PROPOSALS
COULD LEAD TO AN OTHERWISE

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.509
UNJUSTIFIED TIMING OF FINANCIAL
CONDITIONS.

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.510
THEY ARE THE KIND OF THINGS
THIS PRESIDENT AND WHITE HOUSE

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:04.516
DOES NOT WANT TO SEE. ANNMARIE:
YOU PUT CAP ON SOMETHING AND IT

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:12.524
MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS
OF SOMETHING.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:13.525
WHICH IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUSHBACK

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:19.531
FROM A LOT OF ECONOMISTS.
YOU SEE A LOT OF BANK CEOS NOT

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.533
JUST TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR WITH
THE PRESIDENT, CALLING

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.535
TREASURY, BUT IF THEY HAVE TO,
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:27.539
POTENTIAL CREDIT CARD THEY
COULD, WHAT THAT HAS A LOWER

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:31.510
RATE, MAY BE FOR CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:32.511
BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A
YEAR-LONG STORY.

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.514
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU HAVE TWO
BILLS CIRCULATING IN CONGRESS.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.516
JONATHAN:
ED MILLS OF RAYMOND JAMES WITH

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:42.521
US NOW. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS IS
POPULIST BARK, THERE IS NO BITE.

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:47.526
DO THINK THERE COULD BE A BITE
LATER THIS YEAR? ED: POSSIBLE.

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:51.530
I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE FOR A
LOT OF FOLKS I HAVE TALKED TO

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.535
IS THAT CREDIT CARD COMPETITION
ACT. IT WAS NOT A SENSE THAT WE

00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:00.939
COULD SEE IN CONGRESS A CAP ON
THOSE CREDIT CARD INTEREST

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:04.510
RATES. HAVE EXAMINED THIS.
IT WAS NO EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY,

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:07.513
EVEN USING EMERGENCY AUTHORITY
THAT EXISTS TO PUT THIS THROUGH.

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:12.518
A LOT OF INVESTORS ARE NERVOUS
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:15.521
ONE, WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS
SOMETHING OFTEN TIMES HE GOES

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:17.523
OUT WITH THE MOST EXTREME
POSITION, AND THEN NEGOTIATES

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:21.527
INTO SOMETHING THAT WILL BE
CONSIDERED REASONABLE LATER.

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:22.528
IS HE GOING TO BE 36%?
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE OUT

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:27.533
THERE?
I'M AN INVESTOR PERSPECTIVE ONE

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:30.536
THING WE HAVE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT AT RAYMOND JAMES IS OFTEN

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.539
TIMES FOR FINANCIALS YOU NEED
100 REASONS TO OWN THEM, ONE

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.542
REASON TO SELL THEM.
INVESTORS ARE STARTING TO WARM

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.511
UP TO FINANCIALS AGAIN AND OUT
OF THE BLUE WE START GETTING

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.515
BOMBARDED WITH SOME OF THESE
ONE OFFS THAT GET A LOT OF

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.518
PEOPLE ASKING, CAN YOU SUSTAIN
A RALLY IN THIS GROUP IF YOU

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.087
ARE GOING TO HAVE THE POLICY
RISK?

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:51.256
ANNMARIE:
FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER CREDIT

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:54.526
CARDS OTHER NEW COCKROACHES.
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.529
LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS YOU
THINK THE COMPETITION BILL HAS

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.530
A LOT MORE RAGS -- LEGS THAN
THE CAP ON CREDIT CARD INTEREST

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:06.538
RATES? ED:
BACK WHEN I WORKED ON CAPITOL

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.542
HILL ONE OF THE BILLS I WORKED
ON WAS THE CARD ACT.

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.511
IT IS HERE ON MY WALL, WHICH
IMPLEMENTED THE CONSUMER

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:13.512
PROTECTIONS AROUND CREDIT CARDS.
THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE WORKED

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:19.518 line:92%
ON FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:22.521
WHEN I HAVE SEEN IS THERE IS
NOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR RATE

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:26.525
CAPS BECAUSE THERE ARE CONCERNS
ABOUT CREDIT AVAILABILITY.

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:30.796
HOWEVER, ON INTERCHANGE IT IS A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FIGHT.

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:34.132
YOU HAVE TWO REALLY WELL-HEELED
LOBBIES.

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.535 line:92%
THE RETAILERS VERSUS THE BANKS.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.537
WE IN THE PAST HAVE HAD
LIGHTNING STRIKE IN THE BOTTLE

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:44.509
AND CHANGE DEBIT CARD
TRANSACTIONS.

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.511
MARSHALL, A REPUBLICAN FROM
KANSAS, USED THE PUSH BY DONALD

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:49.514
TRUMP ON RATE CAPS TO GET HIM
ONTO THIS BILL, ON CREDIT CARD

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:52.517
COMPETITION.
WHENEVER THERE IS A VOTE ON

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:56.521
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE THE WHOLE
BALLGAME.

00:20:56.521 --> 00:21:00.525
THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERTED
EFFORT SINCE THE AMENDMENT

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:02.527
PASSED IN 2010 ON A CREDIT CARD
INTEREST TO NEVER HAVE ANOTHER

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:03.528
VOTE ON THIS, BECAUSE WHEN
THERE IS A VOTE IT IS

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:09.534 line:92%
UNPREDICTABLE.

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.536
I STILL DON'T THINK IT PASSES,
BUT THE RISK IS HIGHER ON THE

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:15.540
INTERCHANGE BILL THAN THE CAP
ON INTEREST RATES. ANNMARIE:

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.510
DO YOU THINK THE BANKS ARE
OVERREACTING A LITTLE BIT? ED:

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:21.513
I THINK WITH THE BANKS ARE
DOING IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:26.518
WHAT THEY CAN DO TO PUT A CAP
ON THE RISK.

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:27.519
IS THERE SOMETHING THEY CAN DO
FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE TO

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:29.521
GET DONALD TRUMP TO FOCUS
ELSEWHERE? HE IS VERY FOCUSED ON

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:35.527
AFFORDABILITY.
THEY ARE HAVING A HUGE LIST OF

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:40.532
OTHER THINGS THEY WANT TO SEE
HAPPEN IN D.C..

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:43.535
THE DEREGULATORY AGENDA IS BIG
FOR THE BANKS.

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:46.538
IF THEY DON'T DO SOMETHING ON
CREDIT CARDS SOME OF THE OTHER

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:50.542
PARTS OF THE DEREGULATORY
AGENDA GET SIDELINED?

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.511
DO THEY NOT GET THE RELIEF THEY
ARE EXPECTING ON TAILORING MORE

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:57.516
CAPITAL RETURN ON STRESS TESTS?
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THE

00:21:57.516 --> 00:22:00.519
BANKS HAVE GOING RIGHT NOW IN
D.C., THEY DO NOT WANT THIS TO

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:04.523
BE THE THING THAT STOPS ALL OF
THE OTHER BENEFITS THEY ARE

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:05.791
GETTING OUT OF FEDERAL
REGULATORS. JONATHAN:

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:07.859
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR REACTION TO
THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.528
MAYOR OF NEW YORK?
FROM THE SENATOR OF

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:10.529
MASSACHUSETTS?
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY FOR THE

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:15.534
WHITE HOUSE? ED:
PART OF THE REASON DONALD TRUMP

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:22.207
WAS ABLE TO GET ELECTED IN 2016
AND 2024 WAS TAPPING INTO

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:24.109
POPULISM.
THERE WAS A CROSSOVER BETWEEN

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:27.679
BERNIE SANDERS VOTERS AND FOLKS
WHO HAVE VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:31.516
IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.
IT IS NOT A SURPRISE TO ME THAT

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:35.520
HE HAS EMBRACED SOME OF THESE
CONVERSATIONS, AND THE CREDIT

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.522
CARD 10% CAP, THAT IS A BERNIE
SANDERS BUILD WITH JOSH HAWLEY,

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:40.525
A REPUBLICAN FROM MISSOURI.
HE IS TAPPING INTO THINGS HE

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:46.531
KNOWS ARE POPULAR WITH VOTERS.
HE SEES WHAT MAMDANI WAS ABLE

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:50.535
TO DO IN THE PRIMARY, BEING
ABLE TO WIN IN NEW YORK.

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:54.539
TAPPING INTO AN ENERGY THAT HE
TAPPED INTO HIMSELF AND SEEMED

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:56.541
TO SEEING IF HE CAN GET THAT
FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS

00:22:56.541 --> 00:23:00.512
BECAUSE HE'S -- HE SEES A
MIDTERM ELECTION WITH HEADWINDS.

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:05.517
HE THINKS HE CAN FIX THE
PROBLEM. JONATHAN:

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.519
HOW BIG IS THAT GROUP OF VOTERS
THAT ARE NOT MARRIED TO A

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:11.523
POLITICAL PARTY BUT TAP INTO
THESE IDEAS? ED:

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:14.526
IT IS AT LEAST 10%.
I THINK THERE IS A GOOD NUMBER

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.528
OF FOLKS WHO LOOK AT D.C.
AND DO NOT THINK THEY ARE ON

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:17.529
THEIR SIDE.
THEY THINK THAT THINGS ARE

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:24.536
UNAFFORDABLE.
SO, WHEN WE HAVE AFFORDABILITY

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:25.537
AS HIS PITCH HE THINKS IT IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THOSE

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:29.541
VOTERS OR KEEP THOSE VOTERS ON
HIS SIDE.

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.511
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DAVOS
SPEECH THAT FOCUSES ON HOUSING.

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:36.515
WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON ENERGY.
THAT BRINGS IN VENEZUELA.

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:40.519
THE FIGHT WITH JAY POWELL, HE'S
NOT GOING TO SAY IT IS A FIGHT

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:45.524
ABOUT INDEPENDENCE.
IT IS A FIGHT ABOUT HOW MUCH IT

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:48.527
COST YOU TO RUN YOUR LIFE AND
AFFORDABILITY IS A MUCH BETTER

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:51.530
PLACE TO PUT YOUR -- KIND OF
CENTER THAT POLITICAL FIGHT

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.532
VERSUS A FIGHT OVER
INDEPENDENCE, WHICH MOST VOTERS

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:55.534
DON'T REALLY FOCUS ON THAT
INDEPENDENCE.

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:57.936
IT IS MUCH MORE THE MARKET THAT
DOES.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.239
IT IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT THING
BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT SWAYS

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:04.509
THE AVERAGE VOTER. JONATHAN:
THEY WILL FEEL IT IF IT FALLS.

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:05.510
ED MILLS OF RAYMOND JAMES.
THEY WILL FEEL IT WITH HIGH

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:10.515
RATES. ANNMARIE:
BUT ALSO ONE THING TO NOTE,

00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:14.519
WHEN THERE WAS POLLING DONE
ABOUT THE HIGHEST RANKING

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:17.856
POLITICIANS, JAY POWELL CAME
OUT ON TOP AHEAD OF EVERYONE.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:20.192
JONATHAN:
WE WILL TALK ABOUT CENTRAL-BANK

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:22.527
INDEPENDENCE.
HE WILL CATCH UP WITH VERONICA

00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:02.667
WE HAD THAT SOFTER CPI PRINT

FOR FED RATE CUTS.
PLUS ALL OF THE POLITICAL

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:07.873

A CASH OFFER FOR WARNER BROS.
DISCOVERY TO SPEED UP A SALE IN

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.897
A FIGHT THAT HAS TURNED
INCREASINGLY CONTENTIOUS.

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:36.868
JUST THIS WEEK WE HAD
PARAMOUNT'S GUY DANCE SAYING IT

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.870
WAS SUING AND PLANNING TO
NOMINATE DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.872

ITS ADRS ARE FALLING MORE THAN
10% IN THE PREMARKET ON NEWS

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:57.889
CHINA'S MARKET WATCHDOG HAS
LAUNCHED AN ANTITRUST PROBE ON

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:00.892
IT JUST AHEAD OF THE BUSY LUNAR
NEW YEAR TRAVEL PERIOD.

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:04.896
THIS IS THE SAME REGULATOR THAT
INVESTIGATED ALIBABA.

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:08.867
THAT LED TO A RECORD FINE.
CHIP.COM SAYS IT IS COOPERATING.

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:11.870
JONATHAN: THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.
I PROMISED YOU SOME BANK

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.873
EARNINGS.
THE LATEST FROM WELLS FARGO

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.875
CROSSING MOMENTS AGO.
WITH THOSE NUMBERS HERE IS DANI

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:23.882 line:92%
BURGER. DANI: IT IS A MESS.

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:26.885
THIS IS THE ONE SENDING SHARES
LOWER, COMING IN FOR THE

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:30.889
QUARTER AT $12.3 BILLION.
THE ESTIMATE WAS FOR 12.4

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:36.895 line:92%
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:42.867
AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FEES DID
MISS ON INVESTMENT BANKING.

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:44.869
THE ESTIMATE WAS JUST FOR UNDER
$800 MILLION.

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:50.875
EXPENSES, THOSE ARE ALSO HIGHER.
$13.7 BILLION.

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:58.883
THE ESTIMATE WAS FOR 13.6
BILLION.

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:01.886
SO, JUST TO RECAP, IT IS HIGHER
EXPENSES, WORSE THAN EXPECTED

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:04.889
NET INTEREST INCOME, WORSE THAN
EXPECTED INVESTMENT BANKING

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:07.892
FEES.
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE SOME OF

00:27:07.892 --> 00:27:09.894
THE MORE IMPORTANT NUMBERS,
BECAUSE THIS IS A WELLS FARGO

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:12.897
THAT IS TRYING TO GROW MORE
AGGRESSIVELY.

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:15.867
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND QUARTER
WHERE WELLS FARGO DOES NOT HAVE

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:18.870
ITS ASSET CAP PROVISION.
SOMETHING THE FEDERAL RESERVE

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.873
PUT ON IT IN 2018 AFTER A
STRING OF SCANDALS TIED AROUND

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:26.878
IMPROPER CUSTOMER PRACTICES.
THEY HAD TARGETED AGGRESSIVE

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:27.879
GROWTH FOR BOTH ITS INVESTMENT
BANKING, FOR LOANS, FOR THE

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:33.885 line:92%
POSITS TOO.

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:35.887
LOANS COMING IN BETTER THAN
EXPECTED, AS DID DEPOSITS, BUT

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:40.892
IT IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE FOR
THEM.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:43.895
THEY ARE SEEING THEIR TOTAL
EXPENSES AT $55.7 BILLION.

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:46.898
THAT IS ABOUT A LITTLE HIGHER
THAN IT WAS FOR 2025, SO THAT

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:50.869
IS NOT GREAT NEWS EITHER.
I JUST WANT TO LAY OUT WHAT

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:53.872
THEY SEE FOR THEIR VIEW OF NET
INTEREST INCOME FOR 2026.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:59.878
THEY ARE SEEING $50 BILLION.
THAT IS A MESS.

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:02.881
AGAIN, WELLS FARGO PUTTING IN
THE COMMENTARY THAT THEY ARE

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:08.887
TARGETING INCREASED GROWTH.
THE CFO SAYING THEY ARE NOW

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:10.889
EXCITED TO COMPETE ON A LEVEL
PLAYING FIELD, BUT FOR NOW THE

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:13.892
NUMBERS ARE NOT MATCHING UP TO
WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE.

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:15.894
JONATHAN:
THAT HEADLINE FROM THE CEO, YOU

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:19.898
NAILED IT.
PLAGUED BY THE ASSAY CAP FOR SO

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:23.868
LONG.
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:26.871
INVESTORS WILL GIVE THIS
COMPANY A PASS THIS MORNING?

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:29.874
DANI:
THE ISSUE IS THAT THE SHARES

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:30.875
HAVE BEEN OUTPERFORMING, SO
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN GIVING THEM

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:37.882
ROOM TO GROW.
THEY HAVE RALLY 34% IN 2025.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:40.885
THAT COMPARES TO 14% FOR THE
S&amp;P FINANCIALS INDEX.

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.887
THEY ARE COMING FROM A LOWER
LEVEL THAN OTHER BANKS, SO

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:47.892
MAYBE THERE IS ROOM FOR
INVESTORS TO GIVE THEM THE TIME.

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:51.896
THIS IS THE STORY FOR THE BANK
EARNINGS THIS QUARTER.

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:54.866
THAT THEY ARE TRADING AT RICH
VALUATIONS, SO NOW IS THE TIME

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:57.102
TO SHOW UP WITH THE ANIMAL
SPIRITS REIGNITED IN THIS

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:58.870
MARKET. JONATHAN:
WE SAW THAT WITH JP MORGAN

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.874
YESTERDAY.
A SMALL MESS, BUT THAT IS NOT

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:05.877
OK GIVEN THE RATHER WE HAVE
SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR.

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:09.881
WELLS IS DOWN ABOUT .8%.
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES TIME WE

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:13.885
SHOULD GET NUMBERS FROM BANK OF
AMERICA. THANK YOU.

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:20.892
WELLS FARGO DOWN THERE BY .8%.
SOME OF OUR TOP STORIES.

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:23.895
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP URGING
IRANI TO CONTINUE PROTESTING,

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:27.866
SAYING HELP IS ON THE WAY.
THE PRESIDENT ADDING, HE WILL

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:30.702
ACT ACCORDINGLY ONCE ASSESSING
HOW MANY DEMONSTRATORS HAVE

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:33.872
BEEN KILLED. ELSEWHERE THE U.S.
SUPREME COURT RELEASING

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:36.875
DECISIONS AT 10:00 A.M.
EASTERN TIME, INCLUDING

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:39.878
POSSIBLE RULING ON LIBERATION
DAY TARIFFS.

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.881
THE JUSTICES WILL DETERMINE IF
THE WHITE HOUSE BYPASSED

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:47.886
CONGRESS.
FINALLY, CHINA'S TRADE SURPLUS

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.888
SURGING IN 2025.
FUELED BY A JUMP IN GLOBAL

00:29:49.888 --> 00:29:52.891
EXPORTS.
SHARE OF CHINESE EXPORTS

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:57.896
FALLING TO A HISTORIC LOW LAST
YEAR. ANNMARIE:

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:59.898
WHAT CHINA IS DOING IS FINDING
OTHER MARKETS THEY COULD SELL

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:04.869
TO OR OTHERS MAY VIEW AS
DUMPING ON OTHER MARKETS.

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:07.872
SOUTHEAST ASIA, LATIN AMERICA,
EUROPE, WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:11.409
A BIG PROBLEM IN TERMS OF
HOLLOWING OUT THERE BIG

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:13.878
INDUSTRIES.
BUT I FIND JUST PRECIOUS AND

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:16.881
RICH THIS MORNING IS A COMMENT
FROM A CHINESE OFFICIAL TALKING

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:20.885
ABOUT THE FACT THAT, ACTUALLY
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS BIG OF A

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.887
SURPLUS, IT WOULD BE MORE
BALANCED -- THEY ARE SAYING IT

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:25.890
WOULD BE MORE BALANCED IF WE
DID NOT HAVE THESE EXPORT

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.892
CONTROLS AND HIGH TARIFF RATES
AND WE COULD IMPORT MORE WHEN

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:30.895
IT COMES TO THE HIGH-TECH
SECTOR FROM THE UNITED STATES.

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:32.897
BUT CHINA, THEY WILL FIND OTHER
PLACES TO PUSH ALL OF THEIR

00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:36.868
GOODS. JONATHAN:
OBJECTIVES MATTER AND LISTENING

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:43.875
TO THE TREASURY SECRETARY OVER
THE LAST YEAR IF YOU ASK HIM

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.877
ABOUT TARIFFS AND WHAT THE GOAL
WAS, WANTING TO BRING

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:48.880
MANUFACTURING HOME, THE OTHER
WAS A BIG PUSH FROM THE

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.883
TREASURY TO PUSH THE CHINESE TO
CHANGE THEIR ECONOMIC MODEL AND

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.886
REDUCE THEIR DEPENDENCE ON
EXPORTS.

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:56.888
OBVIOUSLY THINGS ARE WORKING TO
SOME EXTENT TO BRING

00:30:56.888 --> 00:31:01.893
MANUFACTURING HOME, TO REDUCE
EXPORTS. BUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:05.897
ELSEWHERE, THE TRADE SURPLUS IS
OUT OF -- IS AT A RECORD.

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.866
IF YOU WANT THE CHINESE TO
CHANGE THEIR ECONOMIC MODEL YOU

00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:10.869
NEED THE EUROPEANS TO COME
ALONG WITH YOU. ANNMARIE:

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:14.873
ALSO SOME COUNTRIES IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA.

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.875
LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
INDIA.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:17.876
COULD INDIA ALSO PUT UP SOME
WALLS WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA?

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:22.881
LATIN AMERICA?
WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING ABOUT

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:26.885
THE TREASURY SECRETARY, WHO
CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT, CHINA

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:30.889
NEEDS TO REBALANCE THEIR
ECONOMY.

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.892
HE ONCE DESCRIBED TO ME IS THAT
FILM "FANTASIA,"

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:40.798
HE MOP AND IT CONTINUES TO HAVE
A SPILL AND IT IS CONTINUOUSLY

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:41.866 line:92%
CYCLICAL. JONATHAN:

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.869
LET'S FOCUS ON THE U.S. ECONOMY.
TRADERS ADDING TO RATE CUT

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:46.871
THAT'S WITH AN EXPECTED CPI
PRINT.

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:53.878 line:92%
MORE DATA ON DECK THIS MORNING.

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.880
VERONICA CLARK OF CITI WRITING,
FURTHER SHIFTS AWAY FROM THE

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.616
UPSIDE SHOULD HAVE FED
OFFICIALS MORE COMFORTABLE

00:31:58.616 --> 00:32:01.753
CUTTING RATES FURTHER IN MARCH,
JULY, AND SEPTEMBER.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.889
GOOD MORNING.
LET'S GET TO THOSE THIS

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:08.893
INFLATIONARY TAIL INTO 2026.
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THAT?

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.895
VERONICA:
ALL OF THE Q4 DATA IS HARD TO

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:11.896
READ.
WE HAD A LOT OF MEASUREMENT

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:15.867
ISSUES AROUND THE GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:20.872
BUT I THINK IT IS WORTH SAYING
WE WERE EXPECTING TO SEE MORE

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:21.873
OF A REBOUND FROM THAT WEEK IN
NOVEMBER IN THE DECEMBER CPI WE

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:27.879 line:92%
GOT YESTERDAY.

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.881
WE DID NOT SEE THAT AND IF YOU
GO BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.883
SHUTDOWN WE HAD SOME SOFT
READINGS FOR SEPTEMBER.

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:34.886
I THINK THAT IS A NUMBER OF
MONTHS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:35.887
SURPRISED LOWER AND THERE IS A
LOT OF WEIRD DETAILS, BUT THAT

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:39.891
IS A CONSISTENT SURPRISED LOWER.
JONATHAN:

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:46.898
INFLATION CLOSER TO 3% THAN IT
IS 2%. VERONICA:

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:47.865
ALL OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING
INDICATORS WE HAVE FOUR

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:50.868
IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF
CONSUMER PRICES HERE I'M

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:54.872
THINKING OF SHELTER INFLATION
-- YOU CAN LOOK AT HOME PRICES,

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:59.877
MARKET RENTS, NEW MARKET RENT
DATA. THOSE TEND TO LEAD SHELTER

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:02.880
INFLATION FROM A YEAR,
YEAR-AND-A-HALF, NINE MONTHS,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.885
THEY HAVE BEEN ABNORMALLY WEAK
FOR ALL OF FIVE.

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:09.887
I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT
SHELTER INFLATION AND CPI COULD

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:13.891
HAVE A PERIOD WHERE IT IS
SOFTER THAN NORMAL. ANNMARIE:

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:16.894
HOW MUCH YOUR ENERGY PRICES
CONTRIBUTE INTO INFLATION?

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.896
VERONICA: IT IS PART OF IT.
BUT THEN YOU DO HAVE STRENGTH

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:22.867
IN ELECTRICITY AND THINGS LIKE
THAT.

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:25.870
THAT IS ALWAYS A CONCERN FOR
HOW THAT COULD FEED INTO GOODS

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:31.876
PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION
COMPONENTS OF CORE INFLATION.

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:32.877
WHEN WE LOOK AT CORE INFLATION
WE EXCLUDE THOSE ENERGY COSTS,

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:37.882
BUT OIL PRICES, LOWER.
HOME PRICES SLOWING.

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:42.887
WAGE GROWTH THAT IS SLOWING
MORE. STOP THOSE INFLATIONARY

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:48.893
PRESSURES ARE NOT AS CORE AS
THEY WERE YEARS AGO. ANNMARIE:

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.895
THE PRESIDENT SAID, YOUR
DOUGHNUTS GOING TO TRUCKS THAT

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:53.898
GET TRANSPORTED TO YOU, BUT I
LOOK AT FOOD AND HOME IS A

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:54.866
RESTAURANT AND THAT INFLATION
IS INCREASING AS THEY ARE

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:58.770
TRYING TO HAVE THIS
AFFORDABILITY PUSH. VERONICA:

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.775
THE PAST THERE HAS NEVER VARIED
-- YOU CANNOT ESTIMATE IT

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:04.876 line:92%
PRECISELY.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.878
I WOULD BE CAUTIOUS ON THINKING
LOWER ENERGY PRICES ARE GOING

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:10.882
TO HAVE SOFTER INFLATION.
IT IS EVERYTHING ELSE TOO.

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:11.883
JONATHAN:
HOW ARE YOU PAIRING THIS WITH

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:16.888
YOUR VIEW ON THE LABOR MARKET?
VERONICA:

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:20.892
THEY CAN GO HAND-IN-HAND.
THIS IS A LABOR MARKET

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:24.562
GRADUALLY WEAKENING.
IT HAS REALLY BEEN THREE YEARS

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:28.733
NOW WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
HAS INCREASED SOMETHING LIKE

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:32.870
.4% EVERY YEAR.
THAT IS A REALLY SLOW INCREASE

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.872
IN EMPLOYMENT, BUT THAT IS WHAT
IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:35.873
YOU SEE A WEAKENING LABOR
MARKET AND THAT IS WHAT SLOWS

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:40.878
INFLATION. JONATHAN:
THE FED HAS BEEN CUTTING

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:43.881
INTEREST RATES AND PEOPLE ARE
TALKING UP THE TALK OF TAX

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:48.886
REFUNDS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL
MONTHS.

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:51.889
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
TALKING -- WHY DO YOU THINK THE

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.892
LABOR MARKET HAS BEEN LEFT
BEHIND? VERONICA:

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.894
WE HAVE SEEN REALLY RESILIENT
GROWTH.

00:34:56.894 --> 00:35:00.898
CONSUMER SPENDING HAS BEEN
STRONG.

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.867
OBVIOUSLY PART OF GROWTH IS
ALSO A I-RELATED INVESTMENT,

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:06.871
WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BE SO
LABOR-INTENSIVE.

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:11.876
MAYBE THAT IS NOT SUPPORTING
THE LABOR MARKET AS MUCH.

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:12.877
WE HAVE HAD THREE YEARS OF
PRETTY CONSISTENT, VERY GRADUAL

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:19.884
WEAKENING IN THE LABOR MARKET,
BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL SPENDING.

00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:21.886
I WOULD WORRY THAT AS WE GET TO
HIGHER LEVELS FOR THE

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:22.887
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND INCOMES
ARE SLOWING THAT IS A HEADWIND

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:29.894
FOR CONSUMPTION. ANNMARIE:
JP MORGAN RECENTLY CAME OUT

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:32.897
WITH A NOTE SAYING, NO MORE
CUTS THIS YEAR.

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.032
YOU HAVE THREE CATS FOR THIS
YEAR.

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:39.036
IS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE
FED CHANGE HOW YOU ARE THINKING

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.872
ABOUT THE CUTS? VERONICA:
NOT PARTICULARLY.

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:46.878
THE DRAMA, OF COURSE.
NOT IN A BIG WAY.

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.880
I THINK CHAIR POWELL AND MOST
FED OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO MAKE

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.884
DECISIONS BASED ON THE DATA AT
HAND.

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:55.887
THEY WILL KNOW THAT NOT CUTTING
RATES BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:56.888
WANTS YOU TO IS JUST AS BAD AS
CUTTING RATES BECAUSE THE

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:58.890
PRESIDENT WANTS YOU TO.
I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING TO

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:04.896
BE A BIG INFLUENCE THE SHIP.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:05.897

EACH HE IS DISSOLVING THE
COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT.

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:37.895
SOURCES SAYING TACKY ICHI AIMS
TO HOLD AN ELECTION THAT WOULD

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:42.867
ALLOW HER TO PRESS AHEAD WITH
HER HAWKISH DIPLOMATIC AGENDA

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.869
AND PRO-STIMULUS ECONOMIC
POLICIES.

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:49.874
SHE SAYS SHE WILL GIVE MORE
DETAILS NEXT MONDAY.

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:52.877
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
EASING EXPORT RULES FOR

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.880
NVIDIA'S AI CHIPS TO CHINA.
THE U.S.

COMMERCE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT
WILL REVIEW APPLICATIONS

00:36:57.882 --> 00:37:02.887
CASE-BY-CASE, ALTHOUGH
COMPANIES MUST FOLLOW

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.890
REQUIREMENTS.
EXPORTERS MUST ALSO LIMIT

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.891
SHIPMENTS TO CHINA TO 50% OF
U.S. PRODUCTION.

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:10.895
THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.
JONATHAN:

&gt;&gt; THE OUTLOOK IS VERY POSITIVE

CONSIDER REAL GDP GROWTH
PROBABLY COMES IN THIS YEAR

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:25.209
AROUND 2%. JONATHAN:
MORE BANK EARNINGS UP NEXT.

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:30.648
WE WILL CATCH UP WITH CHRIS
MARINAC OF JANNEY MONTGOMERY

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:33.884

THE S&amp;P WE ARE DOWN BY .6 ON

THEY ARE OVERCAPITALIZE.
GOING TO BE BUYING BACK STOCK

GOING TO GET REGULATORY RELIEF.

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:23.434
THE PROFITABILITY FOR THE
INDUSTRY IS VERY STRONG.

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.435
JONATHAN:
THE BAR WAS HIGH FOR THESE GUYS.

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:29.440
IF AMERICA JUST BEAT IT.
DANNY HAS THE NUMBERS. DANI:

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.441
THE NUMBERS LOOK GOOD.
LET'S START WITH NET INTEREST

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:38.449
INCOME.
THIS NOW REPRESENTS A NEW

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:39.450
RECORD FOR NET INTEREST INCOME
FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER COMING

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:45.423
FROM BANK OF AMERICA.
THAT FIGURE IS $15.75 BILLION.

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:46.590
THE ESTIMATE WAS FOR $15.48
BILLION.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.426
THAT IS ABOVE THE GUY THAT
BRIAN MOYNIHAN GAVE JUST ONE

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:51.429
MONTH AGO.
HE PRIMED THIS MARKET FOR A

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:56.100
SURPRISE TO THE UPSIDE.
THE GOOD NEWS ALSO FOR BANK OF

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.470
AMERICA IS THAT THEIR
INVESTMENT BANKING FEES ALSO

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.440
OUTPERFORMED.
WE RECALL YESTERDAY THAT J.P.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.441
MORGAN HAD A MISS, SAYING SOME
OF THE DEALS WERE EXTENDED INTO

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:06.444
2026.
THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:12.450
ISSUE FOR BANK OF AMERICA.
INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.451
COMING IN AT 1.6 $7 BILLION.
THE ESTIMATE WAS FOR JUST UNDER

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:17.421
THAT AMOUNT.
THEIR DEBT UNDERWRITING DID

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:20.424
MISS, BUT THEIR TRADING
REVENUE, THAT IS A BEAT.

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:22.526 line:92%
4.5 BILLION DOLLARS.

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:26.697
COMPENSATION EXPENSES, THOSE
ARE HIGHER, BUT MAYBE THE

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:32.436
MARKET CAN OVERLOOK THAT.
WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:36.440
THIS IS ALSO BRIAN MOYNIHAN
WHICH A MONTH AGO HAVE BEEN

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.445
VERY BULLISH ON THE U.S.,
CONSIDERING BANK OF AMERICA'S

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.446 line:92%
EXPOSURE.

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:45.449
HE CONTINUES THAT BULLISHNESS,
WRITING IN THIS RELEASE WITH

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.451
CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES
PROVING RESILIENT, AS WELL AS

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:48.452
THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND
TAX AND TRADE POLICIES COMING

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:52.423
INTO SHARPER FOCUS.
WE EXPECT FURTHER ECONOMIC

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:59.430
GROWTH INTO THE AIR WHILE ANY
NUMBER OF RISKS CONTINUE.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.432
NO COMMENTS AS OF YET IN THIS
RELEASE ABOUT WHAT THE CREDIT

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:05.436
CARD LOOK AHEAD IS WITH THAT
10% CAP, BUT JUST GIVEN BANK OF

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:09.206
AMERICA'S EXPOSURE THEY WILL BE
CLOSELY LISTENING TO BOTH THE

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:12.643
MEDIAN ANALYST CALL, WHETHER
RYAN MONAHAN AND THE TEAM GET

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:16.447
INTO THAT. JONATHAN:
I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:20.451
C-SUITE IS LESS CONFRONTATIONAL.
BUT I WILL BE ALL EARS AS WELL

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:23.421
LOOKING AHEAD TO THAT EARNINGS
CALL.

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:29.427
THIS C-SUITE IS COMING OFF THE
BACK OF AN INVESTOR DAY.

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:31.429
SAYING WE ENTERED 2026 FOCUSED
ON IMPROVED PROFITABILITY.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:35.433
HOW BIG IS THIS YEAR FOR THE
TEAM? DANI:

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:36.434
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE
ANOTHER BIG YEAR.

00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:40.438
THEY ARE GUIDING FOR SOME
SERIOUS BIG DEALS.

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:42.440
THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A RAILROAD
ONE WHICH I SHOULD POINT OUT

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.444
WELLS FARGO IS POINTING TO AS
WELL.

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:50.448
BUT IT IS BOTH SIDES OF BANK OF
AMERICA'S BUSINESS, WHICH THEY

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:52.450
ARE LEADING TO, HOPING FOR A
BIG YEAR.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.451
FOR 2026 THEIR NET INTEREST
INCOME GROWTH IS GOING TO BE 5%

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:58.422
TO 7%.
FOR THE FIRST QUARTER THEY SEE

00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:05.429
THAT GROWTH COMING IN AT 1%.
THEY ARE EXPECTING TO DELIVER

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:08.432
TWO BASIS POINTS OF OPERATING
LEVERAGE IN 2026.

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:10.434
EXPENSES, THOSE LOOK TO BE
ABOUT 4%, BUT IT IS SOMETHING

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:15.439
JP MORGAN WAS TRYING TO INTO AT
AS WELL.

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.441
THAT THEY CAN BECOME MORE
EFFICIENT, THEY CAN GET THAT

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.443
PRODUCTIVITY BOOST FROM
DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS, AND THEN

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:23.447
YOU HAVE THE DEALS AND WHAT
THEY SEE AS A STRONG ECONOMY.

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.449
THIS IS A BANK WRITING TO A
STRONG 2026. JONATHAN:

YESTERDAY WE HAD SOME DECENT
NUMBERS FROM JP MORGAN.

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:42.433
SOME POCKETS OF WEAKNESS AND
THE STOCK FELL 4%.

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.435
THIS MORNING WE HAVE A SERIES
OF BEATS FROM BANK OF AMERICA

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.438
AND THE STOCK IS UP.
IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN TAKE

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:52.443
AWAY FROM THE EARLY REACTION TO
SOME OF THESE DECENT NUMBERS?

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.378
CHRIS:
I THINK THE MARKET TENDS TO

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:57.681
SELL THE NEWS, SO I'M NOT
SURPRISED BY THAT AT ALL.

00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:00.451
I WAS ENTHUSED TO SEE THE
STRONG CREDIT DETAILS THAT --

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:01.452
AT BANK OF AMERICA.
COMMERCIAL LOSSES ARE DOWN.

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:06.423
OVERALL LOSSES ARE DOWN.
THAT IS A VERY GOOD THING.

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:10.427
THAT'S GOING TO CREATE
FLEXIBILITY ON CREDIT COSTS.

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.429
IF THEY CAN CONTINUE TO GROW
REVENUE ON TOPLINE SPREAD AS

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:17.434
WELL AS THE INVESTMENT BANKING
CHANNEL IT IS A VERY GOOD YEAR.

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.436
I THINK THE STOCK MARKET
SNIFFED THIS OUT, SO THAT IS

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:25.442
WHY YOU SEE SOME PROFIT TAKING.
TODAY WILL NOT BE AS BULLISH,

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:26.443
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS
A GOOD SET UP FOR THE FIRST

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:28.445
QUARTER AND THE FULL YEAR.
JONATHAN:

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:31.448
THE COMMENTARY IS PRETTY SOLID.
WE ARE BULLISH ON THE U.S.

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:36.420
ECONOMY. IS IT THAT SIMPLE?
IF THE ECONOMY DOES WELL THESE

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:39.423
COMPANIES DO WELL, THESE STOCKS
SHOULD DO WELL? CHRIS:

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:43.427
I AGREE WITH THAT.
THAT IS THE CASE.

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.428
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ROCKET
SCIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:47.431
BANKS ACT.
THEY ARE STILL INEXPENSIVE

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:51.435
RELATIVE TO THE S&amp;P.
WE USED TO SEE THESE STOCKS

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:55.439
TRADED 70% OF THE S&amp;P.
THERE IS A COME BACK ON

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:57.775
VALUATIONS.
IF YOU CAN HAVE THE ECONOMY

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:01.445
MOVE FORWARD THESE COMPANIES
ARE POISED TO MAKE A LOT OF

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:03.447
MONEY.
AGAIN, CREDIT COSTS CAN BE

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.549
TAMED AND THAT HELPS THE BOTTOM
LINE. ANNMARIE:

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:08.452
CAN THEY ALSO BE CONTAINED IF
WE GET MORE POPULIST POLICIES

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:11.422
OUT OF WASHINGTON?
I'M LOOKING AT THEIR

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.425
PRESENTATION.
THEY HAVE ADDED 3.8 MILLION NEW

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:18.429
CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS.
YESTERDAY FOR JP MORGAN THERE

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:22.433
WERE 10 MILLION.
ARE THEY LESS VULNERABLE TO

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:28.439
SOME OF THESE POLICIES? CHRIS:
EVERYONE IS VULNERABLE BECAUSE

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.441
THEY ARE CONCENTRATION OF ONLY
A FEW LARGE BANKS WHO DO CREDIT

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.444
CARD LENDING.
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.447
DOESN'T DO MUCH OF IT.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.449
HAPPEN WITH THESE CREDIT CARD
CHANGES?

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:42.453
I THINK A LOT OF PROPOSALS FALL
DEAD AT THE END OF THE DAY, SO

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:43.420
I'M NOT CONVINCED THIS WILL GO
THROUGH.

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:46.423
EVEN IF IT DOES THESE COMPANIES
ARE RESILIENT.

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:47.424
THEY ARE VERY WELL-POSITIONED
ON CAPITAL RESERVES AND THEY

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:52.429
CAN PIVOT IF THEY NEED TO.
ANNMARIE:

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:53.430
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DON'T
LIKE OUT OF THIS REPORT FROM

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.432
BANK OF AMERICA? CHRIS:
WE LIKE TO SEE MORE DEPOSIT

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:59.436
GROWTH.
DEPOSITS WERE POSITIVE, BUT WE

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:05.442
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE.
THE INDUSTRY HAD A GREAT

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:06.443
QUARTER ON DEPOSITS, U.S.
DEPOSITS AS WELL AS THE MONEY

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:08.445
MARKETS AND FUND CHANNEL.
THAT HE'S OFFERED GOOD

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:12.449
LIQUIDITY.
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:16.420
MORE EARNINGS ASSET GROWTH FOR
THE BIG BANKS.

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.422
WE DID NOT SEE THAT IN THE
FOURTH QUARTER, BUT I THINK YOU

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:22.426
WILL SEE THAT IN ONE Q.
JONATHAN:

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:27.097
HOW DO YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS
LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS FROM

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:30.567
CITI LATER THIS MORNING AND
MORGAN STANLEY AND GOLDMAN

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:34.438
SACHS TOMORROW? CHRIS:
THE BANKS HAVE HAD A HUGE RUN

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:38.442
IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE MONTHS.
I THINK YOU'RE MIDSIZE AND

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:39.443
SMALLER BANKS ARE STILL IN A
CATCH-UP OMIT.

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:43.447
NOT THAT THE LARGE BANKS ARE
NOT GOING TO DO WELL, BUT YOU

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:45.449
CAN SEE A CATCH-UP TRADE IN THE
MID-CAPS.

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:49.420
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE
LIKE FIRST CITIZENS AND FOR

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:51.422
WORDS AND DOWN TO PINNACLE.
THOSE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:54.425
BETTER VALUATION PICKUP.
THE BUSINESS FOR ALL OF THESE

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:59.430
WILL BE GOOD FOR THE YEAR.
JONATHAN:

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.431
DO YOU THINK THE SMALLER NAMES
ARE MORE INSULATED BY THE

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:05.436
ONSLAUGHT OF HEADLINES COMING
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? CHRIS:

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:06.437
ABSOLUTELY, AND I THINK THE
WHITE HOUSE STILL LIKES

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.439
COMMUNITY BANKS.
ULTIMATELY THAT IS GOING TO

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:12.443
HELP THE SMALL-CAP COMPANIES.
THERE IS DEFINITELY A MOVEMENT

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:16.447
TO SUPPORT THE BANKING INDUSTRY
ACROSS ALL ASSET SIZES.

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:21.452
ANNMARIE:
WHEN YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:24.421
POLICIES COMING OUT OF THE
ADMINISTRATION -- TRADE, TAX,

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:28.425
DEREGULATION -- BUT AT THE SAME
TIME GOING AFTER BANKS WHEN IT

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:32.429
COMES TO THIS PUSH FOR CREDIT
CARDS AND THE INTEREST RATE

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.431
CAP, HOW DO YOU THINK THE BANKS
RATE DOING BUSINESS IN THIS

00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:37.434
ENVIRONMENT WITH THIS
ADMINISTRATION?

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:41.438
IT WAS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT
ABOUT DEREGULATION AND

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:42.439
POTENTIAL M&amp;A, AND ALL OF A
SUDDEN THERE HAS BEEN OTHER

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:49.446
POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN
HEADWINDS. CHRIS:

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:52.449
SO, THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS THE
EXAMINER'S ATTITUDE, MAKING M&amp;A

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:56.420
EASIER TO CLOSE.
THOSE ARE HUGE CHANGES.

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.422
I THINK THE CREDIT CARD CHANGES
ARE NOISE.

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.424
IT IS UNFORTUNATE, BUT I THINK
WE WILL FIGHT THAT BATTLE AND

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:07.998
MOVE ONTO THE BIGGER PICTURE.
I ALSO THINK THAT M&amp;A APPROVALS

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:16.173
ARE MUCH FASTER THAN THEY USED
TO BE. AND WE COULD SEE LARGE

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.441 line:92%
COMBINATIONS. ONCE.

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:19.443
SEE IS ACQUIRED THAT TEASE UP
ACQUISITIONS.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:24.448
I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE
ACTIVITY BECAUSE OF THE

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:31.421
REGULATORY WINDOW NOW -- WINDOW.
JONATHAN: TOP PICKS? CHRIS:

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:34.424
FIRST CITIZENS, PINNACLE, ALSO
LIKE AMYRIS BANK. JONATHAN:

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:38.328
CHRIS MARINAC ON THE FINANCIALS.
NOT JUST THE BIG PLAYERS, THE

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:41.532
SMALLER ONES AS WELL.
A VERY BIG PLAYER DELIVERED

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:45.435
NUMBERS. BACK OF AMERICA.
A SERIES OF BEATS FROM THEM AND

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:51.441
THIS COMMENTARY FROM BRIAN
MOYNIHAN. WITH CONSUMERS PROVING

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:55.445
RESILIENT, AS WELL AS TAX AND
TRADE POLICIES COMING INTO

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:59.449
FOCUS, WE EXPECT FURTHER
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:02.452
WHILE ANY RISKS CONTINUE, WE
ARE BULLISH ON THE U.S. ECONOMY.

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:04.421
ANNMARIE:
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS THIS

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:07.424
AFFORDABILITY PUSH AHEAD OF THE
ELECTIONS.

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:09.426
POTENTIALLY THIS IS THE WRITTEN
STATEMENT.

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:11.428
WHAT HAPPENS ON THE EARNINGS
CALL WHEN YOU START ASKING

00:47:11.428 --> 00:47:14.431
QUESTIONS ABOUT FED
INDEPENDENCE?

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.433
THERE HAS BEEN THIS
DEREGULATORY PUSH WHICH THE

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:21.438
BANKS HAVE WELCOMED.
THEY HAVE REALLY WELCOMED FROM

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.440
THIS ADMINISTRATION, BUT AT THE
SAME TIME TRADE POLICIES IS

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:27.444
GOING TO COME IN SHARPER FOCUS
TODAY AT 10:00 A.M.

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:31.448
A LOT OF THIS COULD BE UNWOUND
IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS WALL

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.450
STREET HAS HAD ON TRADE POLICY
IF THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:36.420
THIS MORNING TO STRIKE DOWN THE
PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS. JONATHAN:

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:39.423
THAT STOCK IS POSITIVE ON THE
PREMARKET.

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:44.428
THAT IS THE LATEST FROM BANK OF
AMERICA.

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:47.431
ALREADY THIS OUR NUMBERS FROM
BANK OF AMERICA AND WELLS FARGO.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:50.434
IN ABOUT ONE HOURS TIME WE WILL
HEAR FROM CITI.

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:55.439
LATER THIS MORNING AS WELL,
SOME ECONOMIC DO FOR YOU.

00:47:55.439 --> 00:48:01.445
PPI AND U.S. RETAIL SALES.
UP NEXT WE WILL CATCH UP WITH

ANDREW BALLS OF PIMCO, KATE
KALUTKIEWICZ, AND DAVID KELLEY

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:06.450

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:48.191
LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD
MORNING.

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:52.195
FOR THE AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE COME
THE SECOND HOUR STARTS NOW.

00:48:52.195 --> 00:49:02.205
THE PRICE ACTION LOOKS LIKE
THIS. DOWN 5.4% ON THE S&amp;P.

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.206
BACK TO BACK -- DOWN BY .4% ON
THE S&amp;P.

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:06.209
IT LOOKS A LITTLE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:12.215
60 MINUTES FROM NOW WE SHOULD
GET NUMBERS FROM CITIGROUP.

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:17.187
30 MINUTES AFTER THAT, DATA,
PPI AND RETAIL SALES.

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:20.190
MAYBE LATER THIS MORNING WE GET

THIS LIBERATION DAY TARIFFS.
ANNMARIE:

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:27.197
I SAY WE GET THAT RULING TODAY
AND DAVOS IS NEXT WEEKEND THEY

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:29.266
ARE STRUCK DOWN, THAT WILL BE A
DIFFERENT DAVOS FOR THIS

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.200
ADMINISTRATION.
POTENTIALLY COUNTRIES LINING UP

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:36.206
TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR DEALS.
TODAY THE FOCUS IS THE BANKS.

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:38.208
BANK OF AMERICA, PRETTY
INCREDIBLE QUARTER.

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:42.212
THE COMMENTARY FROM THE C-SUITE.
MAYBE SOME SHADE FROM YESTERDAY

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:46.216
WITH JAMIE DIMON.
IN THE EARNINGS RELEASE HE DID

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:49.786
SAY WE ARE SEEING A RESILIENT
U.S. CONSUMER.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.189
WHAT IS BRIAN MOYNIHAN SAYING
TODAY?

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:56.193
WE ARE BULLISH ON THE U.S.
ECONOMY FOR 2026. JONATHAN:

00:49:56.193 --> 00:50:01.198
THE BARS ARE REALLY HIGH FOR
THE BANK NAMES.

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:02.199
THE STOCKS HAVE ALREADY HAD A
FANTASTIC RUN.

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:07.204
WE SAW THAT WITH JP MORGAN
YESTERDAY.

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:09.206
THIS MORNING BANK OF AMERICA,
VERY GOOD NUMBERS.

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:14.211
THE STOCK IS UP BY ABOUT 1%.
GIVEN THE YEAR WE HAD FOR SOME

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:16.213
OF THESE NAMES YOU WILL NEED A
TREMENDOUS BEAT TO GENERATE A

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:20.217
BIG RALLY. ANNMARIE:
THE CFO TALKS ABOUT STRONG

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:25.188
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL.
JP MORGAN YESTERDAY DID HAVE

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:30.193
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TERMS OF
THE CREDIT CARD.

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:32.195
THEY HAVE A LOT OF DEAL FLOW
WITH THE DEALS DID NOT FINISH

00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:35.198
IN TIME FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER.
POTENTIALLY THEY WILL BE ABLE

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:39.202
TO BRING IN REVENUE THIS YEAR.
THIS IS WHAT I FIND THE BANKS

00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:43.206
INTERESTING AT THIS EXACT
MOMENT.

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:44.207
YOU HAVE CONGRESS AND THE
PRESIDENT CALLING SOMEONE LIKE

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:53.216
ELIZABETH WARREN.
THE PRESIDENT HAVING THIS IT

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:57.187
ALMOST FEELS LIKE A BROMANCE
WITH ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.189
DID YOU HAVE THIS POPULIST
TRUTH SOCIAL POST COMING OUT

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:04.194
BUT A YEAR WHERE THEY WERE
PUSHING FOR THIS DEREGULATION

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:07.197
PUSH AND IT'S OFF TO THE RACES
FOR THESE FINANCIAL LENDERS.

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:09.199
JONATHAN:
THE MEDIA CALL IS ABOUT 10 OR

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:15.205
15 MINUTES AWAY.
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW BANK OF

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:16.206
AMERICA HANDLES SOME OF THOSE
QUESTIONS VERSUS WHAT WE HEARD

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:19.209
FROM JAMIE DIMON YESTERDAY.
ANNMARIE:

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:23.213
JAMIE DIMON WAS A LITTLE SNARKY.
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:27.217
IT HE SAID I THINK JAMIE DIMON
IS WRONG WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:30.187
CONSEQUENCES.
JAMIE DIMON SAID THAT COULD BE

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.192
WHEN IT COMES TO FED
INDEPENDENCE MAYBE BRIAN

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:38.195
MOYNIHAN WILL TAKE A DIFFERENT
APPROACH AND WE WILL WAIT FOR

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:40.197
THIS TO PLAY OUT AND LOOK AT
WHAT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:45.202
TELLING YOU.
THE MARKETS ARE NOT PRICING IN

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:49.206
A TURKEY-ARGENTINA CENTRAL BANK
OF THE UNITED STATES. JONATHAN:

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:52.209
YIELDS ARE DOWN BY THREE BASIS
POINTS.

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:57.214
YIELDS DOWN AT THE LONG AND BY
THREE BASIS POINTS.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.215
WE WILL CATCH UP WITH ANDREW
BALLS AS BIG BANK EARNINGS ROLE

00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:02.219
IN. WE WILL SPEAK WITH KATE
KALUTKIEWICZ ON A POTENTIAL

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:06.189
SUPREME COURT TARIFF OPINION.
WE WILL CATCH UP WITH DAVID

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:08.191
KELLY AS PRESIDENT TRUMP RAMPS
UP THE PRESSURE ON THE FED TO

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:10.460
CUT RATES.
STOCKS HOLDING STEADY FOLLOWING

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.197
AN EARNINGS MISS FROM WELLS
FARGO AND AN UPSIDE SURPRISE

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:17.200
FOR BANK OF AMERICA.
ANDREW BALLS EXPECTING ECONOMIC

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:22.205
RESILIENCE.
"THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:26.209
EXPECT SUPPORT AND GROWTH WITH
THE TREND TOWARDS WINNERS AND

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:30.213
LOSERS IS LIKELY TO PERSIST."
ANDREW, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:32.215
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE THING,
SOMETHING REALLY BORING WHICH

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:35.218
IS TRADITIONALLY NOT HOW WE
START A CONVERSATION BUT THAT

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:42.192
IS THE 10-YEAR TREASURY.
I'M LOOKING FOR A NATION.

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.193
WHY THING SO QUIET IN THE
TREASURY MARKET WHEN THINGS ARE

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:48.198
SO NOISY EVERYWHERE ELSE?
ANDREW:

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:52.202
WE HAVE HAD A PRETTY ROBUST
RANGE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:57.207
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF NEWS.
WE HAVE HAD SIX MONTHS WORTH OF

00:52:57.207 --> 00:53:05.215
NEWS IT FEELS LIKE THE FIRST
COUPLE WEEKS OF THE YEAR.

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:09.219
THE TREASURY MARKET IS PRETTY
CALM IN THE FACE OF THE LATEST

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:13.123
CHALLENGES TO THE FED AND ALL
THE OTHER THINGS GOING ON.

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:15.992
THE INTERVENTIONS IN THE
MORTGAGE MARKET IS A

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:19.196
SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE.
WE THINK IN TERMS OF THE AGENCY

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:26.203
MORTGAGE MARKET.
IN BROAD TERMS YOU HAVE

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:30.207
INFLATION COMING DOWN, GROWTH
RESILIENT.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:35.212
QUITE POSSIBLY BROADENING
BEYOND JUST THE AI, CAPEX, DATA

00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:39.216
CENTER PART OF THE ECONOMY.
DEALING WITH THE FISCAL SUPPORT

00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:50.193
IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.
A PRETTY REASONABLE OUTLOOK.

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.195
IN SPITE OF THE CHALLENGES WE
SEE, THE ECONOMY IS DOING QUITE

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:57.200
WELL IN SPITE OF THE TARIFF
SITUATION. WINNERS AND LOSERS.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:04.207
WE SEE WEAKNESS IN THE LABOR
MARKET.

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:09.212
CAUTION ON THE PART OF HIRING
DECISIONS ACROSS THE ECONOMY.

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.214
IT REMAINS A DIFFICULT ALEC TO
JUDGE BUT PRETTY RESILIENT IN

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:14.217
TERMS OF U.S. OUTPUT. JONATHAN:
I WILL TURN BACK TO THE BOND

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:18.188
MARKET LATER.
HEADLINE GROWTH IS GREAT.

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:24.194
IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS.

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:25.195
IS THE DISPARITY BENEATH WITH
THE POLITICIANS AS THEY SEEK TO

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:30.200
ADDRESS INEQUALITY.
WITH THAT SHAPE TOPLINE GROWTH?

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.203
-- WILL THAT SHAPE TOPLINE
GROWTH? ANDREW:

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:37.207
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WINNERS AND
LOSERS.

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:40.210
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL HAVE
ONGOING POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:46.216
AIMED AT AFFORDABILITY IN THE
U.S.

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:52.188
WE HAVE TO TAKE THESE AS THEY
COME.

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:54.190
WHEN I STEP BACK, THE 10-YEAR,
OR BROAD NET TO THE MARKET IN

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:59.195
THE U.S., THE U.S.
BOND MARKET AGGREGATE TYPE

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:04.200
FUNDS, YOU CAN GET 6% PLUS IN
TERMS OF THE YIELD.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:09.205
THIS LOOKS VERY GOOD IN TERMS
OF THE RETURN INVESTORS CAN GET

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:14.210
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS
STILL TRICKY, STILL DIFFICULT

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.212
IN TERMS OF THE CROSSCURRENTS,
THE WINNERS AND LOSERS, THE

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:22.218 line:92%
POLICY UNCERTAINTY.

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:24.187
AT A TIME WHEN THE EVALUATIONS
FOR EQUITIES, THEY LOOK PRETTY

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:32.195
FULL FOR THE U.S. MARKET.
BEING ABLE TO GET PAID MAYBE 7%

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:38.201
FOR A HIGH-QUALITY BOND FUND
LOOKS VERY GOOD GIVEN THE

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.202
DOMESTIC UNCERTAINTY AND THE
INTERNATIONAL UNCERTAINTY WE

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:45.208
ARE FACING.
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.210
TARIFFS TODAY AT 10:00 A.M.
AND THEY HAVE GENERATED $171

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:50.213
BILLION OF REVENUE FOR THE
TREASURY.

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:54.217
IF WE HAVE A DECISION TODAY
THAT RULES IEEPA ILLEGAL, COULD

00:55:54.217 --> 00:56:00.190 line:92%
OF THE BOND MARKET? ANDREW:

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:05.195
I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS THAT
PENDING THE SUPREME COURT

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:09.699
DECISION, IF THIS GOES AGAINST
THE ADMINISTRATION, THERE ARE

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:13.703
WAYS THE ADMINISTRATION CAN
REINSTATE SIMILAR LEVELS OF

00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:16.206
TARIFFS.
THERE WOULD BE UNCERTAINTY.

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:22.212
YOU COULD HAVE SOME REACTION
BUT IN BROAD TERMS THE

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:26.216
EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT YOU
RE-CREATE SIMILAR TARIFFS,

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:29.219
SIMILAR REVENUE RAISING IN A
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORMAT.

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:35.191
ANNMARIE:
THE OTHER DRAMA -- TALKING

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.193
ABOUT HOW THE 10-YEAR TREASURY
YIELD HAS BEEN BORING, WHY ARE

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.194
WE NOT SEEN BONDS MOVE ON
CONCERN ABOUT FEDERAL RESERVE

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:44.100
INDEPENDENT? ANDREW:
THE BASELINE AND THE RISK CASE.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:51.508
IN THE BASELINE, YES, THERE IS
NOISE AROUND THE FEDERAL

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:55.178
RESERVE.
THE REAPPOINTMENT -- SORRY, THE

00:56:55.178 --> 00:57:02.485
NEW APPOINTMENT OF THE FED
CHAIRMAN THIS YEAR IS VERY

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:03.219 line:92%
IMPORTANT.

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.187
LEGAL CHALLENGES AGAINST THE
SITTING CHAIR CERTAINLY ARE NOT

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:09.192
WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE FROM A
BOND MARKET POINT OF VIEW.

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:13.196
IN THE BASELINE IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS IS PROBABLY MORE NOISE.

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:19.202
THE FED IS PRICED TO GET DOWN
TO ABOUT 3% THIS YEAR.

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:26.209
IT ALL LOOKS PRETTY REASONABLE.
3% FOR THE TERMINAL RATE, 4%

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:30.213
FOR THE 10-YEAR TREASURY.
IT LOOKS VERY REASONABLE.

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:36.219
THEN YOU HAVE THE RISK CASE.
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, HARD TO

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:41.191
SEE FED HIKES WITH THE
INFORMATION WE HAVE THIS YEAR

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:44.194
AND PROBABLY RISKS TOWARDS
LOWER TERMINAL RATES.

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:47.197
YOU CAN POSITION FOR THAT ON
THE YIELD CURVE.

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:51.201
YOU CAN BE LONGER FRONT END OF
THE CURVE, THE FIVE-YEAR PART

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:57.207
OF THE CURVE.
YOU CONSIDER A CURVE STEEPEN OR.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.209
THAT HAS BEEN WORKING --
STEEPENER.

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.211
THAT HAS BEEN WORKING THE LAST
FEW DAYS.

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:04.214
LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES IS
BECOMING MORE ATTRACTIVE.

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:10.186
I THINK YOU CAN POSITION FOR
THIS.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.957
THE MARKETS HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF
CREDIBILITY OR DESCRIBED A LOT

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:17.694
OF CREDIBILITY TO THE FED IN
TERMS OF THE STRENGTH OF THE

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:20.196
INSTITUTION.
I THINK THAT IS RIGHT IN THE

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:24.200
BASELINE, EVEN WITH THE CHANGE
IN THE FED CHAIR.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.204
IT IS ONE AMONG THE GROUP THAT
MAKE THE DECISIONS.

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:31.207
THE RISK CASE I THINK IS
TOWARDS LOWER INTEREST RATES.

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:35.211
WE CAN POSITION FOR THAT.
AT PIMCO WE ARE POSITIONING FOR

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:38.214
THAT ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIOS.
JONATHAN:

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:41.217
ARE YOU POSITIONING FOR HIGHER
RATES IN PLACES LIKE JAPAN?

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:49.192
ANDREW: IT'S INTERESTING.
WE HAVE THIS PERIOD SINCE 2008

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:52.195
WHEN YOU HAD VERY HIGH LEVELS
OF CORRELATION.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:58.201
CENTRAL BANKS STUCK AT THE
LOWER BAND OR THE QE, ETC.

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:03.206
THEN IT'S MORE INTERESTING IN
TERMS OF GLOBAL MACRO.

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.208
DO HAVE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY
MAY BE TIGHTENING THIS YEAR.

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:12.215
JAPAN IS PRICED TO TIGHTEN.
AUSTRALIA IS PRICED TO TIGHTEN.

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:14.217
CANADA PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE.
THE FED, THE U.K.

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:24.193
PRICED TO EASE.
EMERGING MARKETS PRICED TO EASE.

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:27.196
YOU HAVE A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR
CROSS MARKET POSITIONING,

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:30.199
GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION GIVEN
ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES, THE

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:36.205
CHALLENGES WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT.
GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION MAKES

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:42.211
MORE SENSE THAN NORMAL IN THIS
ENVIRONMENT.

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:46.215
THE FRONT END OF THE CURVE, A
DIFFERENT CURVE, STEEPENING

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:51.187
TRADES ACROSS COUNTRIES.
POLITICS DRIVING MARKETS IN

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:54.190
JAPAN AT THE START OF THE YEAR.
THE CLEAR INDICATION OF A SNAP

00:59:54.190 --> 01:00:00.196
ELECTION TO COME.
THE PRIME MINISTER HOPING TO

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:04.200
GET A MANDATE FOR MORE ACTIVE
FISCAL POLICY.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.202
DIFFERENTIAL FISCAL POLICY
ACROSS COUNTRIES.

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:13.209
FISCAL LOOSENING.
JAPAN, U.S., CANADA, GERMANY

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:16.212
ARE TRYING TO TIGHTEN IN THE
U.K..

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:22.218
FRANCE TENDS TO BE TIGHTER ON
THE EMERGING-MARKET SIDE.

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.187
THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES
HERE FOR THE CROSS-COUNTRY

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:30.193
RELATIVE VALUE TRADING.
JONATHAN: A FINAL NOTE ON JAPAN.

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:33.196
THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND
MARKET HAS BEEN AN ANCHOR TO

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:37.200
GLOBAL BOND YIELDS.
IT FEELS LIKE IT IS ANCHORS

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.203
AWAY, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST
FEW WEEKS.

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:44.207
THE PROSPECT OF SNAP ELECTIONS
AND MAY BE MORE FISCAL STIMULUS.

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.209
HOW INSULATED IS SOMETHING LIKE
THE TREASURY MARKET TO THE

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.210
FORCES BUILDING IN A PLACE LIKE
THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.811 line:92%
MARKET? ANDREW:

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:56.919
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD WAY TO
START OUR INVESTMENT COMMITTEE

01:00:56.919 --> 01:01:00.123
BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS.
YOU CERTAINLY SEE SPILLOVER

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:05.061
FROM JAPAN TO THE REST OF THE
WORLD AT THE LONG END OF THE

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.196
CURVE.
POTENTIALLY THE FRONT END OF

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:11.200
THE CURVE.
I THINK THIS DEEP THIS OF THE

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.204
CURVE IN JAPAN IS VERY
INTERESTING.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:22.211
YOU SEE THIS LEADING AND TERMS
OF THE GLOBAL CURVE SHAPE OTHER

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.213
COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN MOVING IN
THAT DIRECTION.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:28.217
THERE IS SOME SPILLOVER WHEN
YOU QUANTIFY IT.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:35.191
IT IS NOT HUGE BUT THE
POTENTIAL VOLATILITY FROM JAPAN

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:38.194
THIS YEAR IS JUST ANOTHER CAUSE
FOR INTERESTING MARKETS AND

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:44.200
PROBABLY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES.
JONATHAN:,

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.201
LOVER, NOT A FIGHTER.
WHO WANTS TO FIGHT AT NEWPORT

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:49.205
BEACH, CALIFORNIA?
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:53.209
ANNMARIE: IT IS A GREAT GIG.
JONATHAN:

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.546
ANDREW BALLS TRUMP PIMCO WITH
THE LATEST ON THE MARKET.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.882

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:22.205

FADING.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:25.208
STRONG AI AND DATA CENTER

POINTS TO THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL
BILL. ANNMARIE:

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.186
HE'S BASICALLY SAYING THE
SUBTEXT OF ALL OF THESE IS IT

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.189
IS AN ELECTION YEAR.
A MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR IN THE

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:44.193
WHITE HOUSE IS THROWING
EVERYTHING OF THE WALL TO TRY

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:47.196
TO GET COSTS DOWN,
AFFORDABILITY CONTINUING TO BE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.198
NUMBER ONE WHEN IT COMES TO
POLLING.

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:55.204
ALSO IT COMES FROM TORSTEN SLOK
WHO IS THE WHITE HOUSE'S

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.205
FAVORITE ECONOMIST. HE SAID
TRUMP FOOLED US ALL WHEN IT

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:58.207
COMES TO THE TRADE TARIFF
NEGOTIATIONS.

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.209
WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION, IT
HAS ONLY BEEN A ONE TIME PRICE

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:04.213
SHOCK. JONATHAN:
THAT IS THE LATEST FROM TORSTEN

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:12.188
SLOK OVER AT APOLLO.

THE CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN SAYING
HE IS BULLISH ON THE U.S.

THE SUPREME COURT EXPECTED

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:37.213
RELEASE OPINIONS AT 10:00 A.M.
THIS MORNING AND WE ARE WAITING

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:40.216
FOR THE COURT TO RULE ON THE
LEGALITY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:45.188
LIBERATION DAY TARIFFS.
THE JUSTICES WILL DECIDE OF

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:51.194
WHITE HOUSE BYPASSED CONGRESS

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.195
PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUING TO
PUSH FOR U.S.

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:56.199
OWNERSHIP OF GREENLAND.
HE POSTED THIS MORNING THAT

01:03:56.199 --> 01:04:02.205
NATO SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY
FOR US TO GET GREENLAND.

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.207
IT COMES AHEAD OF A MEETING
BETWEEN TOP DIPLOMATS FROM

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:07.210
GREENLAND AND DENMARK AND
SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:09.212

AFTERNOON.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:14.217
THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:17.053
UP NEXT, BRACING FOR A TARIFF
DECISION.

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:21.524
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE SUPREME COURT
THAT WILL RULE ON WHETHER OR

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:25.194

THAT ARE CHINA-CENTRIC.

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:32.201

WE DON'T WIN BUT WE SHOULD WIN.
JONATHAN:

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:38.207
THAT CONVERSATION UP NEXT WITH
KATE KALUTKIEWICZ.

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:43.579
FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD
MORNING. ♪

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.683
JONATHAN:
STOCKS ARE A LITTLE SOFTER FOR

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:53.689
A SECOND DAY.
ON THE NASDAQ 100, DOWN BY .6%.

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:59.695
BRACING FOR A TARIFF DECISION.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:01.697
THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE IF
WE CAN USE TARIFFS.

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.666

I CASE BROUGHT ABOUT BY PEOPLE

THAT ARE CHINA-CENTRIC.
FOREIGN-CENTRIC.

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:14.677
I WOULD NOT WANT IT IF I WAS
CHINA EITHER.

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:17.680
CHINA IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST
TAXPAYERS RIGHT NOW.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.682
WE WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT IF
WE DON'T WIN BUT WE SHOULD WIN.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:24.687
JONATHAN:
THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.690
COULD COME AS EARLY AS TODAY.
TYLER KENDALL JOINS US FROM

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:34.697
WASHINGTON. IT TODAY THE DAY?
TYLER: IT MIGHT BE.

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:39.669
SOME ARE POINTING TO THE FACT
THAT THE COURT HAS ALREADY

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:40.670
ACTED IN AN EXPEDITED MANNER.
TODAY COULD BE THE DAY WE GET

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.673
THE DECISION, PLUS THE WHITE
HOUSE HAS ASKED THE JUSTICES TO

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:47.677
PRIORITIZE THIS, ARGUING THE
SITUATION IS JEOPARDIZING

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:50.680
FOREIGN POLICY AND ONGOING
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, NOT TO

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.683
MENTION BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TIED UP.

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:56.686
THE SUPREME COURT IS DECIDING
ON THE LEGALITY OF THE TARIFFS

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.689
IMPOSED UNDER IEEPA.
THEY HAVE TWO QUESTIONS IN

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:05.695
FRONT OF THEM.
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:06.696
AUTHORITY TO INVOKE IEEPA TO
IMPOSE TARIFFS?

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:11.100
IT IS TYPICALLY USED FOR
SANCTIONS.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:17.006
IF HE DOES, DID HE INVOKE IT
CORRECTLY?

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:20.676 line:92%
WAS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY HE

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:24.680
DECLARED TO RECEIVE THE -- HE
CITED TRADE IMBALANCES.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:30.686
THIS IS A COMPLICATED TARIFF
REFUND FIGHT.

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:32.688
AS A LAST MONTH THE
ADMINISTRATION RECORDED $133

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:38.694 line:92%
BILLION TIED TO IEEPA TARIFFS.

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:39.695
OUR ANALYST SAY IF TARIFF
REFUNDS ARE ISSUED, IT COULD

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:44.667
JUST REPORTEDLY IMPACT APPAREL
AND TOY COMPANIES.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:45.668
ONE THING IS FOR CLEAR.
NO MATTER HOW THE COURT RULES,

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.670
OFFICIALS SAY TARIFFS ARE HERE
TO STAY.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:52.675
THEY COULD EVOKE MORE SECTION
232 TARIFFS OVER NATIONAL

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.676
SECURITY CONCERNS OR SECTION
301 OF HER UNFAIR TRADE

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:57.680
PRACTICES.
OFFICIALS LIKE TO SAY IEEPA

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.682
GIVES THEM THE MOST LIKABILITY.
JONATHAN:

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.685
TYLER KENDALL, THANK YOU.
KATE KALUTKIEWICZ WITH THIS TO

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:11.694
SAY.
"PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOCUS WILL

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.696
LIKELY SHIFT OF GENERATING WINS
THROUGH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:17.666
AND SECTOR SPECIFIC
INVESTIGATIONS."

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.667
THIS LINE FOR THE PRESIDENT,
"WE WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.670
IF WE DON'T WIN."
WHAT THIS FIGURING SOMETHING

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:26.675
OUT LOOK LIKE? KATE:
WHAT IS CLEAR, INCLUDING THE

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:27.676
CLIP YOU PLAYED IS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:33.682
LET THESE TARIFFS GO.
IF THE SUPREME COURT RULES

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:36.685
AGAINST HIM AND HIS USAGE OF
IEEPA, HE HAS OTHER TARIFF

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:42.691
AUTHORITIES THAT YOU JUST
MENTIONED THAT HE CAN USE TO

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:45.694
OPPOSE THE TARIFFS BACK UP TO
THE SAME LEVELS AND HE SIGNALED

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:50.666
HIS INTENTION TO DO THAT ALMOST
MEDIALLY. ANNMARIE:

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.669
HOW WAS THE FENCE ABOUT PRICE
IS NOT A NATIONAL CRISIS?

01:07:53.669 --> 01:08:00.676 line:92%
-- FENTANYL CRISIS? KATE:

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:03.679
WE MAY WELL SEE A SPLIT
DECISION TODAY.

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:06.682
THE PRESIDENT HAS OPPOSED
TARIFFS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.685
HE LIKES TO USE THEM FOR LOTS
OF REASONS, INCLUDING ISSUES

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:17.693
LIKE THE FENTANYL CRISIS, THE
ORDER CRISIS.

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:23.666
THAT IS WHERE THE FIRST IEEPA
WERE.

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:29.672
THE SUPREME COURT WOULD HAVE
THAT HAS RULED IN HIS FAVOR IN

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:37.680
THE PAST. WE MAY END UP WITH A
DECISION TODAY THAT RULES

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.681
AGAINST CERTAIN TARIFFS, THOSE
IMPOSED FOR TRADE DEFICITS AND

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:42.685
RETAIN FOR OTHER TARIFFS.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE SOME

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.687
TIME TO ANALYZE WHATEVER THE
SUPREME COURT PUTS OUT BEFORE

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:50.693
COMPANIES MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:51.694
ANNMARIE:
LET'S LOOK AT THE ONCE A COULD

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.697
BE STRUCK DOWN TODAY.
DOES THE PRESIDENT GO BACK TO

01:08:54.697 --> 01:09:00.669
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE WITH
COUNTRIES OR JUST TRY TO LOOK

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:01.670
AT THINGS THAT HAVE WITHHELD,
GOING AFTER SECTORS LIKE HE HAS

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:08.677
WITH AUTOS? KATE:
IT COULD BE A MIXTURE OF BOTH.

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:13.682
THE SECTOR TARIFFS LIKE AUTOS
AND STEEL AND ALUMINUM HAVE

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:14.683
PROVIDED DURABLE LEVERAGE FOR
THE PRESIDENT TO NEGOTIATE ON

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:18.687
TARIFFS.
THOSE TARIFFS ARE NOT UNDER

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:23.692
DISCUSSION AND NOT UNDER THREAT.
THEY REMAIN REALLY IMPORTANT

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:24.693
PIECES OF LEVERAGE FOR THE
PRESIDENT TO GO TO TRADING

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:30.666
PARTNERS AND SAY LET'S MAKE A
DEAL. IN FACT, THE AGREEMENTS HE

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:35.671
STRUCK WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION,
JAPAN, KOREA AND OTHERS HAVE

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.673
FOCUS REALLY MORE ON THE 232
TARIFFS THAT ON THE IEEPA

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:42.678
TARIFFS.
THOSE AGREED TO HIRE TARIFF

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:46.215
RATES ON THE GOODS TO THE
UNITED STATES.

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:51.487
I DON'T THINK THE SUPREME COURT
IS GOING TO IMPACT THAT

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.055
PARTICULAR SITUATION AT ALL.
ANNMARIE:

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:56.192
THERE'S AN EXIT -- THERE'S
ANOTHER SECTION, THREE THREE

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.694
THREE EIGHT, IS THAT HIS BLOOD
AS IEEPA?

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:03.666
COULD THAT HAVE LEGAL ISSUES ON
THE ROAD? KATE: IT COULD.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:10.673
338 IS ONE.
THERE'S ANOTHER CALLED 122.

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.675
I THINK THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY ON
THE TABLE FOR THIS PLAN B

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:18.681
SCENARIO THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS DESCRIBED.

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:21.684
BOTH DON'T HAVE PERHAPS THE
FLEXIBILITY IEEPA HAS, WHICH IS

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:24.687
WHY THE PRESIDENT PREFERS IEEPA.
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY TOOLS THEY

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:30.693 line:92%
COULD BE USED.

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:31.694
338 IS TIED TO TRADE
DISTURBANCES THAT HAPPENED AT

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:36.665
OTHER ECONOMIES.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE CASES.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.667
I DO THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
WILLING TO USE THESE

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:43.672
AUTHORITIES THAT ARE UNTESTED.
I SUSPECT FOLKS ARE THINKING

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:46.675
ABOUT HOW TO CHALLENGE THEM IF
HE DOES IN FACT USE THEM.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:47.676
JONATHAN:
WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED A LOT OF

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.678
JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THESE
TARIFFS.

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:54.683
WE HAVE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT
RAISE MONEY FOR THEM.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:57.686
TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK
HOME.

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:02.691
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A LOT TO
HIGHLIGHT THOSE PROBLEMS. THE

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.693
BIGGER ISSUE FOR THE GLOBAL
ECONOMY IS CHINA CHANGING ITS

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:09.665
ECONOMIC MODEL.
THIS RECORD TRADE SURPLUS WE

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:12.668
HAVE SEEN THROUGH 2025, EVEN
WITH THE MASSIVE DROP OFF IN

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:16.672
EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES,
WAYS OF PROVING SO DIFFICULT TO

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:19.675
GET CHINA TO CHANGE? KATE:
LOTS OF ECONOMIES LIKE CHEAP

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:25.681
GOODS.
THE PRESIDENT SAID REPEATEDLY

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:28.684
AND I THINK HE IS RIGHT THAT IF
WE ARE GOING TO CONFRONT

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:29.685
CHINESE POLICIES, IT HAS TO BE
DONE AS A GROUP OF LIKE-MINDED

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:36.692
COUNTRIES.
THIS IS WHY YOU SEE THE

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:37.693
PRESIDENT AND THE TRADE TEAM
ARTICULATING AN INITIATIVE IN

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:40.696
THE TRADE AGREEMENTS ON
SOMETHING THEY CALL ECONOMIC

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:45.668
SECURITY, WHICH IS USUALLY
POLICIES GEARED TOWARDS CHINA.

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.669
UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS IT
CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH TO IMPACT

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:52.675
CHINA.
WE HAVE CUT OUR TRADE DEFICIT

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.677
WITH CHINA THROUGH THESE
ACTIONS BUT AS YOU POINT OUT

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:58.681
CHINA HAS HAD OTHER MARKETS TO
SEND GOODS TO.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:02.685
UNLESS AND UNTIL OTHER
ECONOMIES JOINED THE UNITED

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:03.686
STATES IN IMPOSING POLICIES
DIRECTED AT CHINA, I THINK

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.689
CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO FIND
MARKETS. JONATHAN:

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:18.413
DISCOVERY AS IT AIMS TO SPEED
UP A SALE AS THE SAGA HAS GROWN

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:22.417
INCREASINGLY CONTENTIOUS.
YOU HAVE PARAMOUNT SAYING IT

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:24.419
WAS SUING AND HE WAS PLANNING
TO NOMINATE DIRECTORS TO THE

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:31.393
BOARD. NETFLIX TRYING TO END IT.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:34.396
YAHAIRA NOTING DECENT NUMBERS
OUT OF BANK OF AMERICA.

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:38.400
THE MEDIA CALL UNDERWAY.
THESE QUESTIONS WERE GOING TO

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.405
COME UP ABOUT CREDIT CARDS AND
INTEREST RATES.

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:44.406
DANI, BANK OF AMERICA SEEMS TO
BE HANDLING THIS DIFFERENT THAN

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:48.410
JP MORGAN YESTERDAY. DANI:
THE POLAR OPPOSITE IN THEY

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:52.414
DON'T CLEARLY WANT TO COMMENT
ON IT.

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:59.388
THE CFO SPEAKING MOMENTS AGO.
IT WAS THE VERY FIRST QUESTION.

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:00.389
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS
PROPOSED OR ATTEMPTED

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:06.395
ENFORCEMENT OF A 10% CREDIT
CARD CAP FOR INTEREST RATES?

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:09.398
THE CFO SAYS WE ARE SUPPORTIVE
OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:12.401
DOING AROUND AFFORDABILITY.
HE GOES TO THE BANK OF AMERICA

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:16.405
HISTORY, SAYING WE THINK -- WE
DO THINGS LIKE TRY TO LIMIT

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:21.410
OVERDRAFT FEES AND HAVE PRODUCT
SUITES. WE ARE STANDING BY THE

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:25.414
ADMINISTRATION TO HELP THEM,
BUT ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE OF

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.416
CREDIT CARD CAPS ON INTEREST
RATES THEY SAY IT IS FIRMLY IN

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:32.387
THE PUBLIC DEBATE ARENA.
THE ISSUES ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:37.392
AND NOTHING MORE TO ADD.
CLEARLY STEPPING AWAY.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:41.396
THE SECOND QUESTION WAS ON
POLITICS, SAYING ARE YOU READY

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:46.401
TO SUPPORT CLIENTS IN VENEZUELA
FOR VARIOUS OIL PROJECTS?

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.403
THE CFO ALSO DECIDES NOT TO
ENGAGE, SAYING OF COURSE WE ARE

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:49.404
WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO HELP OUR CLIENTS AROUND THE

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:51.406
WORLD.
IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY ANYTHING

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:56.411
ON THIS.
THEY GOT A QUESTION FROM OUR

01:16:56.411 --> 01:17:01.416
OWN PAUL DAVIES AROUND THE
HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.418
THE CFO VERY BULLISH ON THIS,
SAYING ALL METRICS TELL US THE

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:05.387
CONSUMER IS RESILIENT AND
REMAINS IN GREAT SHAPE.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.391
NO SINCE THEY ARE BARRING MORE.
CHECKING ACCOUNTS ARE GROWING

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:16.398
OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR.
THEY ARE SPENDING WELL.

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:20.402
BULLISH ON THE CONSUMER AND
AFFORDABILITY BUT DECLINING TO

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:26.408
ENGAGE IN THE POLITICS.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:30.412
DANI BURGER WITH THE LATEST ON
BANK OF AMERICA.

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:33.415
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
DISMISSING CRITICISM FROM THE

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:34.416
JP MORGAN CEO JAMIE DIMON ABOUT
THE PROBE INTO THE FEDERAL

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:37.419 line:92%
RESERVE.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:41.390
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS FINE WHAT I'M
DOING. WE HAVE A BAD FIT PERSON.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:46.395
HE WAS EXTENDED BY BIDEN.
I THINK HE IS WRONG.

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:50.399
HE'S DONE A BAD JOB.
WE SHOULD HAVE LOWERED RATES.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:55.404
JAMIE DIMON PROBABLY WANTS
HIGHER RATES. JONATHAN:

01:17:55.404 --> 01:18:03.412
THE PRESIDENT FACING BACKLASH
OVER THE INVESTIGATION.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.414
AMAZON LOOKING TO REDUCE WHAT
IT PAYS SUPPLIERS THAT HAVE A

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:08.417
POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT TARIFF
DECISION.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:11.420
THE TECH CHINA'S MOVE INTO
REVERSE SOME OF THE MEASURES

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.389
USED TO EASE THE IMPACT OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDDIES --

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:17.392
THE TECH GIANT.
THEY ARE MEETING WITH DIPLOMATS

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:20.395
FROM DENMARK AND GREENLAND AT
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY TO

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:24.399
DISCUSS HE DEMANDS FOR THE
TERRITORY.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.401
PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTING THIS
MORNING, "AMERICA NEEDS

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:28.370
GREENLAND FOR NATIONAL
SECURITY." ANNMARIE:

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.873
HE MAKES THE CASE THAT NATO
BECOMES MORE EFFECTIVE

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:35.410
AGREEMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF
THE UNITED STATES.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:40.415
THE DANES ARE GOING TO SAY
THERE IS A TREATY DATING BACK

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:42.417
TO THE 1950'S THAT BASICALLY WE
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO COME IN

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.419
AND HAVE A DEFENSE POSTURE ON
GREENLAND.

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:48.390
THIS ALL FEELS WORTHLESS.
THEY NEED AN OFFRAMP TO KEEP

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:52.394
THE PRESIDENT AT BAY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE THIS

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.396
POINT IN HIS FIRST TERM.
I IMAGINE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:57.399
EXPECTING THIS TO COME.
THEY CAN SAY THERE IS U.S.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:02.404
MILITARY PRESENCE.
ADD-ON, BRING MORE TROOPS.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:06.641
WE ARE HAPPY FOR YOU TO MAKE
THIS A FORTRESS.

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:10.879
THEY COULD DO SOMETHING THAT
UKRAINE DID, WHICH IS OFFER

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:13.415
MINERALS.
THE PRESIDENT IS KEENLY FOCUSED

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.416
ON MINERALS AND WE ARE EARTHS,
ESPECIALLY AS YOU SEE CHINA

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:18.420
PULLING BACK EXPORTS TO THE
UNITED STATES. JONATHAN:

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.388
HERE IS THE FOCUS ON THE
DOMESTIC STAGE.

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:25.393
PRESIDENT TRUMP RAMPING UP HIS
BIG PUSH.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:27.395
&gt;&gt; IN THE COMING WEEKS I WILL
BE LAYING OUT EVEN MORE PLANS

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:31.399
TO HELP BRING BACK
AFFORDABILITY.

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:37.405
AS PART OF THE EFFORTS AT DAVOS
I'M GOING TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:39.407
DETAILS ABOUT OUR HOUSING
POLICIES SO EVERY AMERICAN WHO

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:43.411
WANTS TO OWN A HOME WILL BE
ABLE TO AFFORD ONE.

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:46.414
THIS INCLUDES A BAN ON LARGE
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS BUYING

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:47.415
OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY AND MAKING IT

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:53.388
IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BUY A
HOME. JONATHAN:

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:55.390
STEPHEN KIM WRITING, "THE
POTENTIAL WHERE IS GOVERNMENT

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.392
INTERVENTION WILL BRING
PRESSURE ON LARGE PUBLIC

01:19:57.392 --> 01:20:01.396
BUILDERS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
MORE THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:03.398
TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR
MARGINS." GOOD MORNING.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:07.402
THANK YOU FOR DROPPING BY.
IT'S AN IMPORTANT STORY FOR

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:09.404
AMERICANS, HOUSING
AFFORDABILITY.

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:14.776
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE?
WHERE DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:19.281
IS, ON THE DEMAND SIDE, ACCESS
TO CREDIT, BUILDING ENOUGH

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:22.417
HOMES? STEPHEN:
THERE ARE SOME OBVIOUS THINGS.

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:25.420
HOME PRICES RALLIED
DRAMATICALLY POST-PANDEMIC.

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:29.391
HE ALSO HAD MORTGAGE RATES
WHICH ALSO MORE THAN DOUBLED

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:31.393
AFTER THE PANDEMIC AS WELL.
YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER AND

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:35.397
THINGS ARE MUCH LESS AFFORDABLE
THAN THEY WERE IN RECENT MEMORY.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.399
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT.
THERE'S NOT A LOT THEY CAN DO

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:41.102
ABOUT HOME PRICES.
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT HOME

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:44.406
PRICES TO START GOING DOWN ANY
MEASURABLE WAY.

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:45.407
THEY COULD DO SOME THINGS IN
MORTGAGE RATES AND THEY HAVE

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:52.414
BEEN DOING SOME.
I'M SURE WE WILL TOUCH ON THAT.

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:55.050
TO YOUR QUESTION, REMEMBER THAT
HOMEBUYING IS NOT JUST MATH.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.419
IT IS MENTAL.
IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR

01:20:57.419 --> 01:21:01.389
JOB, THE LAST THING YOU WILL DO
IS GO TO BUY A HOUSE.

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:04.392
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEYS, THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:08.396
THEIR JOB, LOSING THEIR JOB, IT
IS VERY HIGH LEVELS.

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:11.399
THAT'S ANOTHER IMPEDIMENT TO
AFFORDABILITY.

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:14.402
A LOT OF THE INSTABILITY PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN FEELING THAT IS ALSO

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:17.405
CAUSING THEM NOT TO BUY.
THAT IS NOT EASY FOR THE

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:21.409
GOVERNMENT TO FIX. ANNMARIE:
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LARGE

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:22.410
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, THEY
ARE LESS THAN 2% OF THE HOUSING

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:28.416 line:92%
MARKET.

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:29.417
STEPHEN:
ONE OF THEM IS NOT HELPING AND

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:33.388
THE OTHER IS HELPING.
THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.389
ANGLE IS SOMETHING I THINK IS
MORE OF A FICTION THAN A

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:39.394
REALITY. I WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD THINK TOO

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:43.398
MUCH ABOUT. ANNMARIE:
PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT SOUNDS GOOD

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:47.402
TO THE EVERYDAY AMERICAN.
STEPHEN:

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:51.406
IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY MAKE AN
IMPACT BUT IT WILL HAVE A

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.408
SLIGHT DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF
BUILDERS WHO WE ESTIMATE MAY BE

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:56.411
SELL ABOUT 5% OF THEIR STUFF TO
INVESTORS.

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.413
THAT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD
THING FOR THE BUILDERS AND THE

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.416
NOTHING BURGER FOR THE MARKET
AS A WHOLE.

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:04.419
THE MORTGAGE RATES IS A BIG
THING FOR EVERYBODY.

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:10.392
WE HAVE SEEN THE
MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:11.393
PURCHASES PUSHED DOWN
IMMEDIATELY AND THE SECURITY

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:14.396
SPREADS OVER TREASURIES BY 20
BASIS POINTS.

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.397
A BIG MOVE THAT BROUGHT
MORTGAGE RATES DOWN SLIGHTLY

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:21.403 line:92%
BELOW 6% BRIEFLY.

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:23.405
THE PROBLEM IS OUR CONTACT
SUGGEST THAT WAS TOO BIG OF A

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:25.540
MOVE.
OTHER PEOPLE SAY IT IS NOT BIG

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.409
ENOUGH.
IT COULD BE 50 BASIS POINTS.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:32.414
WE ARE NOT SO SURE.
200 BILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS LIKE

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:34.416
A LOT BUT IF THAT IS ALL YOU
GET AND THERE'S NOTHING AFTER

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:39.387
THAT, IT WILL NOT HAVE THAT BIG
OF AN IMPACT. ANNMARIE:

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.390
LAST YEAR IT WAS NORTH OF $230
BILLION.

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.392
BILL PULTE WAS ON AND HE SAID
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:48.396
MAYBE THEY WOULD LIFT THE CAP.
STEPHEN:

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:52.400
THAT PROMPTED PEOPLE TO SAY
THIS COULD BE A BIG THING.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.403
$200 BILLION IS JUST A STARTING
THING.

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.404
THEY HAVE $200 BILLION IN CASH
AND THAT IS WHERE THE CASH IS

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:59.407
COMING FROM.
LET'S SAY THEY DO ANOTHER $200

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:04.412
BILLION.
WHERE IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM?

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:06.414
YOU HAVE TO BORROW, PAY
INTEREST AND HEADS THAT RISK.

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:12.387 line:92%
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:17.392
YOU HAVE THE GSE'S COMING IN,
BIG BUYER BUT THEY ARE EXISTING.

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:20.395
YOU WILL SEE PROBABLY BUYERS
STEP BACK TO YOU COULD HAVE

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.797
MORE DISPLACEMENT THAN YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE NET ADDITION.

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:26.701
THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT NOT SEE
THE SPREADS COME DOWN IS MUCH

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:29.404
AS PEOPLE HOPE. JONATHAN:
YOU ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:34.409
PROBLEM FOR INVESTORS NOW.
THE SECTOR HAS A TARGET ON IT.

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:36.411
HOW INVESTABLE IS IT WHEN YOU
GET WHIPSAWED FROM HEADLINE TO

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.413
HEADLINE EVERYDAY FOR THE YEAR
SO FAR? STEPHEN:

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:45.420
ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND
IS WHAT BILL PULTE SPOKE ABOUT

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:49.391
LAST NIGHT, THAT HE BELIEVES
THE BUILDERS SHOULD REFRAIN

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:50.392
FROM DOING SHARE REPURCHASES.
MUCH LIKE WHAT THEY DID ABOUT

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:58.400
THE DEFENSE STOCKS.
WHEN I SAW DEFENSE STOCKS --

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.404
THE THING FROM TRUMP ABOUT
DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEFENSE

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:05.407
NAMES, YOU CAN TAKE THAT EXACT
DOCUMENT I JUST PUT

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:07.509
HOMEBUILDERS IN THERE AND
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I THINK

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.411
YOU WILL GET.
THE BUILDERS BOUGHT BACK 10% OF

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:16.418
THEIR SHARES ALMOST LAST YEAR.
THEY ARE BIG RE-PURCHASERS.

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:19.387
IT IS A NOXIOUS THING FOR THEM
TO WAKE UP AND READ ABOUT.

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.388
ANNMARIE:
IT'S AWKWARD THIS MIGHT HAPPEN

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:26.394
IN DAVOS.
HE WILL BE ADDRESSING PEOPLE

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.396
THAT PAY A MILLION DOLLARS TO
JOIN THIS FORUM THAT THE

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:31.399
PRESIDENT THINK THAT SOME
ELITIST GLOBALIST CABAL.

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:36.404
WHAT IS HE GOING TO SAY?
STEPHEN:

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.406
HE SORT IT TEASED THAT HE'S
GOING TO ANNOUNCE SOME OF THE

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:43.411
BIGGEST HOUSING REFORM THINGS
IN HISTORY.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.412
THEY HAVE ALREADY -- I THINK
THEY COULD NOT QUITE CONTAIN

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.414
THEIR ENTHUSIASM.
THEY PUT OUT A COUPLE OF BIG

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:51.419
THINGS ALREADY.
THE NBS THING IS ACTUALLY A

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:54.389
PRETTY BIG THING.
WHAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY DO

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.391
IS ANNOUNCE THEY WILL LOWER THE
FEES THAT FANNIE AND FREDDIE

01:24:56.391 --> 01:25:01.396
CHARGE FOR THEIR SERVICES.
IT'S ABOUT 40 PACES MUCH HIGHER

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:02.397
THAN THE USED TO BE BUT DON'T
THINK YOU WILL GET 40 BASIS

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:08.403
POINTS.
THAT WOULD GET A TREMENDOUS

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:09.404
AMOUNT OF PUSHBACK.
I'M GUESSING YOU GET 10 BASIS

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:13.408
POINTS OUT OF THE GFP'S.
MAYBE FEDERAL LANDS.

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:16.411
MAYBE GREENLAND.
I DON'T HOW HELPFUL THAT WOULD

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.413
BE.
THEY CAN OPEN FEDERAL LANDS OR

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:24.419
HOMEBUILDING.
THERE IS SOME TAX CREDITS HE

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.387
COULD ANNOUNCE AND THAT WE GET
THE BIGGEST EXCITEMENT.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:30.391
THAT REQUIRES CONGRESS TO SAY
YES. JONATHAN: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:33.394
PLENTY OF ISSUES TO START THE
YEAR. STEPHEN KIM ON THE HOUSING

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:35.396
MARKET.
LET'S CROSS OVER TO VONNIE

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:41.402
QUINN. VONNIE:
THE MAJORITY OF VENEZUELANS

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:46.407
WENT MARIA MACHADO TO RUN THE
COUNTRY.

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:50.411
A SURVEY FINDING WITHIN 51% SAY
SHE SHOULD TAKE OVER.

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:53.414
THE FINDINGS ARE CONTRADICTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLAIM THAT

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:55.416
THE OPPOSITION LEADER DOES NOT
HAVE THE COUNTRY'S SUPPORT.

01:25:55.416 --> 01:26:01.389
SHE IS HEAD OF IS SAID TO VISIT
THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW.

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:05.393
ELON MUSK'S STARLINK SATELLITE
SERVICES OFFERING FREE ACCESS

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:07.395
IN A RUN AMID THE COUNTRY'S
DEADLY CRACKDOWN ON PROTESTS

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:12.400
AND DAYS LONG INTERNAL BLACKOUT
IMPOSED BY THE REGIME.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.401
PAUL STARLINK RECEIVERS ARE
PROHIBITED IN THE COUNTRY, MANY

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:23.411
HAVE BEEN SMUGGLED ACROSS THE
NATION'S BORDERS.

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:30.418
SAKS IS FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY
TO POTENTIALLY FIND A BUYER.

01:26:30.418 --> 01:26:33.388
THEY ARE NOTHING THEY ARE
REPLACING RICHARD BAKER WHO HAD

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:35.890
BEEN AT THE TOP ARE JUST TWO
WEEKS.

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:38.393
THAT IS A BLOOMBERG BRIEF.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:41.396
UP NEXT, THE CASE FOR LOWERING
INTEREST RATES.

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:45.400
&gt;&gt; AND THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU
HAD GOOD NUMBERS, INTEREST

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.401
RATES WOULD GO DOWN.
WHEN YOU HAD GOOD NUMBERS THE

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:50.405
MARKET WOULD GO THROUGH THE
ROOF. OUR GROWTH POTENTIAL IS

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.473
UNLIMITED AND COULD BE MUCH
HIGHER. JONATHAN:

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:55.410
WE WILL TALK TO DAVID KELLY
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:58.413
CORPORATE CREDIT AND SOVEREIGN
DEBT IN A MOMENT.

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:10.391
FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD
MORNING. ♪

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:23.538
JONATHAN:
NUMBERS FROM CITIGROUP IN A

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:26.507
MOMENT.
WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM IN 13

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:29.510
MINUTES.
AFTER THAT, PPI AND U.S.

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:34.515
RETAIL SALES.
EQUITIES A BIT SOFTER, DOWN BY

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:37.518
ONE THIRD OF 1%.
WE ARE DOWN BY .5% ON THE

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:40.521
NASDAQ.
UNDER SURVEILLANCE, THE CASE

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.856 line:92%
FOR LOWERING INTEREST RATES.

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:45.526
&gt;&gt; IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU HAD
GOOD NUMBERS, INTEREST RATES

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:48.529
WOULD GO DOWN.
WHEN YOU HAD GOOD NUMBERS, THE

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:55.536
MARKET WOULD GO THROUGH THE
ROOF. OUR GROWTH POTENTIAL IS

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:57.538
UNLIMITED AND COULD BE MUCH
HIGHER IF WE WENT BACK TO

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:58.539
SANITY.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE THE

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:02.510
FED.
I WANT SOMEBODY THAT WHEN THE

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:06.514
MARKET IS DOING GREAT INTEREST
RATES CAN GO DOWN, BECAUSE OUR

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:10.518
COUNTRY BECOME STRONGER.
JONATHAN:

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:11.519
THE PRESIDENT TOUTING HIS
ECONOMIC A WHILE CONTINUING TO

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:16.524
MAKE THE CASE FOR LOWER
INTEREST RATES.

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:19.527
DAVID KELLY WRITING, "WE EXPECT
THE FED TO TAKE HIS TIME,

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:21.529
LIMITING FURTHER RATE CUTS WITH
TWO IN TOTAL FOR 2026 AND A

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:25.199
FURTHER CUT IN 2027.
WE THINK THIS'LL BE THE CASE

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:29.203
EVEN WITH NEW FED LEADERSHIP."
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE RATE CUTS

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:31.539
BUT LET'S START WITH THE
ECONOMY.

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:34.509
WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR 2026
FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM? DAVID:

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:38.513
PRETTY SOLID.
WE WILL HAVE INCOME TAX REFUNDS

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:42.517
FLOODING IN OVER THE FIRST HALF
OF THE YEAR.

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:46.521
I THINK WE POSSIBLY WILL GET A
TARIFF REBATE CHECK TO KEEP THE

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:49.524
ECONOMY STOPED IN THE THIRD
QUARTER.

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:50.525
WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE FIRST
THREE QUARTERS OF THE YOU TO BE

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:54.529
CLOSE TO 3% GROWTH.
BY THE FOURTH QUARTER I THINK

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:58.533
THINGS FADE.
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER THE

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:01.536
HOUSE YOU HAVE A DIVIDED
GOVERNMENT AND YOU HAVE --

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:09.510
ABOUT 2% GROWTH.
MAYBE 2.5% GROWTH FOR 2026.

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:13.514
SLIPPING DOWN TO ABOUT 1.5%
GROWTH FOR 2027. JONATHAN:

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:16.517
LET'S WORK WITH SOME STRONG
NUMBERS.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:19.520
LET'S SAY THINGS ARE GREAT AND
SOLID ECONOMIC GROWTH.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.521
TYPICALLY THAT IS ON A BACKED
UP WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:24.525
CUTTING INTEREST RATES.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:26.527
PRESIDENT WHEN HE SAID WHEN THE
NUMBERS WERE GOOD, INTEREST

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:31.532
RATES WERE LOWER?
WHAT IS HE GETTING AT? DAVID:

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:34.535
YOU HAVE GOOD NUMBERS ON
INFLATION AND GROWTH.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:37.538
THOSE THINGS HAVE OPPOSITE
EFFECTS ON INTEREST RATES.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:40.508
GETTING BACK TO YOUR DISCUSSION
WITH YOUR GUEST ON

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:43.511
AFFORDABILITY, WHY DO WE HAVE
AN AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM?

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:46.948
IT IS NOT BECAUSE MORTGAGE
RATES ARE TOO HIGH.

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:51.119
THEY WERE WAY TOO LOW IN THE
DECADE AFTER THE GREAT

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:54.522
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST FEW

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:58.526
YEARS OF THE 20 TEENS, WE HAD
SUPER LOW MORTGAGE RATES.

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:02.530
IT CAUSED HOME PRICES TO
SKYROCKET. BET IS THE PROBLEM.

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:04.532
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO NORMAL
RATES -- THESE ARE JUST NORMAL

01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:07.535
MORTGAGE RATES WE HAVE TODAY.
THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL OR

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:11.539
INAPPROPRIATE ABOUT THEM.
THE PROBLEM IS THE AVERAGE

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.508
PERSON CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY THE
REALLY EXPENSIVE HOMES EVEN

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:17.512
WITH AVERAGE MORTGAGE RATES.
THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE MORTGAGE

01:30:17.512 --> 01:30:19.514
RATES.
IT IS WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:23.518
AND WHAT THEY DID TO HOME
PRICES. ANNMARIE:

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:24.519
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE
OLD DAYS.

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:27.522
ARE YOU SAYING WHAT HE IS
TALKING ABOUT IS PRE-THE GREAT

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:32.527
FINANCIAL CRISIS? DAVID:
I WILL DODGE WHAT HE MEANS BY

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:35.530
GOOD NUMBERS.
I WILL NOT TRY TO PARSE THAT

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:40.535
TOO MUCH.
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT INTEREST

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:44.539
RATES TODAY ARE NOT
PARTICULARLY HIGH.

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:47.508
IF YOU GET SUPER LOW INFLATION
AND SUPER LOW INFLATION AND THE

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:48.509
ECONOMY GOES INTO RECESSION,
INTEREST RATES MIGHT COME DOWN

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:52.079
A LITTLE BIT.
WE ARE OBSESSED WITH GETTING

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:56.951
RATES DOWN TO AN APPROPRIATELY
LOW LEVEL AND THAT CAUSES ASSET

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:59.153
BUBBLES.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS A

01:30:59.153 --> 01:31:01.622
CURSE TO THE ECONOMY, IT'S BEEN
ASSET BUBBLES.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:03.524
LET'S TRY TO AVOID THAT.
ANNMARIE:

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.526
YOU THINK WE WILL HAVE TWO CUTS
THIS YEAR? DAVID:

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:10.531
YES, JUST ABOUT.
IT IS A CLOSE CALL.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:12.533
THE FED COULD GIVE US ONE CUT
IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:15.536
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT
PLAYS OUT.

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.537
THE DECISION BY THE SUPREME
COURT ON TARIFFS IS QUITE

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:20.508
IMPORTANT FOR THAT.
IF THE OVERALL LEVEL COMES

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:23.511
DOWN, THAT SHOULD TAKE SOME
PRESSURE OFF INFLATION AND

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:27.515
MIGHT ALLOW THE FED TO CUT
RATES ONCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:30.518
THE YEAR IN THE RIGHT AT THE
END OF THE YEAR I THINK YOU

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:33.521
COULD GET ANOTHER CUT IN
DECEMBER IF INFLATION COMES

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:37.525
BACK DOWN TO 2% WHICH WE THINK
IT COULD BY THE END OF THIS

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:39.527
YEAR.
IF THAT PLAYS OUT, YOU MIGHT

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:40.528
GET TWO RATE CUTS THIS YEAR.
THE FED IS IN NO HURRY TO CUT

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:42.396
RATES.
WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT DOES IN

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:46.434
TERMS OF APPOINTING A NEW FED
CHAIR, THE FED WILL BE IN A

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:49.537
HURRY TO CUT RATES. JONATHAN:
THE GROWTH PROFILE IS DECENT

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:52.507
GROWTH FOR THIS YEAR AND IS
SLOW DOWN INTO 2027.

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.508
EQUITIES HAVE BEEN PRICED FOR
THAT BETTER GROWTH PROFILE FOR

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:57.512
THIS YEAR.
THE MARKET HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON

01:31:57.512 --> 01:32:02.517
2026 AND BETTER GROWTH FOR
QUITE A WHILE.

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:04.519
WHEN IS IT PICK UP ON YOUR
STORY, THE NEXT LEG OF THINGS,

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:08.523
THE DECELERATION INTO 2027?
DAVID:

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:12.527
THIS IS A MARKET THAT IS HARD
TO DEPRESS.

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:16.531
OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF
EMBEDDED CAPITAL GAINS AND THE

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.401
MONEY POURING IN FROM
401(K)S AND STOCK BUYBACKS, YOU

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:24.639
HAVE IS HUGE -- YOU HAVE A HUGE
SURGE IN DEMAND FOR EQUITIES

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:28.509
AND NOT A LOT OF MONEY COMING
OUT OF THE MARKET.

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:29.510
I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S A
MACRO OUTLOOK THAT IS THE

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:34.515
GREATEST RISK TO THE MARKET.
THE GREATEST ECONOMIC AND

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:36.517
FINANCIAL RISK IS THAT
SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH THE

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:39.520
AI HYPERSCALER STORY.
A LOT OF MARKET ENTHUSIASM IS

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.525
CENTERED AROUND THAT.
FOR THE MOMENT I DON'T THINK

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:48.529
THE MACRO NUMBERS WILL SHAKE
THE EQUITY MARKET. JONATHAN:

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:50.531
SOMETHING DID CHANGE WITH THE
MARKET REACTION FUNCTION WITH

01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:53.534
REGARDS TO THE AI TECH STORY
WHEN WE GOT NUMBERS AT

01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:56.537
INCREASED SPENDING IN THE STOCK
MARKET STARTED TO PUSH BACK.

01:32:56.537 --> 01:33:01.509
HOW DO YOU THINK THE MARKET
WILL APPROACH INVESTORS -- THE

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.510
MARKET AND INVESTORS WILL
APPROACH A EARNINGS SEASON AND

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:08.516 line:92%
EXPOSURE TO THIS THEME? DAVID:

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:10.518
THEY WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE
COMPANIES CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:14.522
BECAUSE THERE ARE QUESTIONS
ABOUT GOING A FEW YEARS DOWN

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:18.759
THE ROAD, ARE ALL THESE
COMPANIES -- I WILL NOT MENTION

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:21.295
INDIVIDUAL NAMES -- ARE THEY
ALL SOLVENT?

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:25.533
CLICK CANNOT BE THAT MANY
WINNERS IN THE AI STORY.

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.535
YOU HAVE FIVE OR EVEN
DOMESTICALLY FIVE BIG COMPANIES

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:31.973
TRYING TO CHASE AFTER GENITIVE
AI. THEY CAN'T ALL WIN.

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:37.244
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT DO
SOME OF THEM GET INTO TOO MUCH

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:42.516
DEBT. I THINK THE MARKET WILL BE
FOCUSED ON THAT STORY AND THE

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:46.520
CIRCULARITY IN TERMS OF
EVERYBODY'S CAPITAL SPENDING IN

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.523
THE TECH SECTOR IS SOMEBODY
ELSE'S REVENUE.

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:53.527
YOU CAN DEPRECIATE THE CAPITAL
SPEND.

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:56.530
THE REVENUE IS STRAIGHT TO THE
BOTTOM LINE.

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.531
THIS HUGE FLURRY IS INFLATING
PROFITS IN THE TECH SECTOR AND

01:33:57.531 --> 01:34:01.535
I THINK PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT.
JONATHAN:

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:04.538
IS AT AN ISSUE FOR 2026 OR
FURTHER OUT? DAVID:

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:08.509
IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE FURTHER
OUT. WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:12.513
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NOW AND THE
DOT-COM BUBBLE IS YOU DO HAVE

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:17.518
MASSIVE CASH FLOW FROM THE
HYPERSCALERS WHICH CAN KEEP THE

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:18.519
PARTY GOING EVEN IF PEOPLE HAVE
SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:22.523
VIABILITY OF THE PARTY.
THERE'S ENOUGH CASH TO KEEP IT

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:24.525
GOING WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE IN
THE DOT-COM BUBBLE. JONATHAN:

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:29.530
DAVID, APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
DAVID KELLY OF J.P.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:31.532
MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT ON THE
FUTURE OF THE ECONOMY AND WHAT

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:36.537
IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH AI.
HE WOULD NOT NAME ANY COMPANIES

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:40.508
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED
ON THE FUNDING NEEDS OF ONE

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.510
COMPANY, OPENAI, AND WHETHER WE
GET PUSHBACK FOR THE YEAR AHEAD.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.512
ANNMARIE:
THAT IS THE LITMUS TEST FOR

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:48.516
THIS ENTIRE TRADE AND ENTIRE
MARKET. OPENAI.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:53.521
HOW OVER THAT IPO BE RECEIVED.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF CASH.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:57.525
THE PRESIDENT IS BASICALLY
SAYING THESE COMPANY'S MIGHT

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:58.893
HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE AMERICAN
CONSUMERS' ELECTRICITY

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.528
BILLS.
THIS IS POPULIST IDEAS GOING TO

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:03.531
THE MIDTERM ELECTION BUT IF YOU
ARE A TECH COMPANY, YOU HAVE TO

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:06.534
THINK ABOUT THAT. JONATHAN:
THE PRESIDENT HAS A CURIOUS

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.036
TAKE.
HE BELIEVES THAT IF THE ECONOMY

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:12.640
IS DOING BETTER, WE SHOULD BE
BORROWING AT LOWER INTEREST

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.509
RATES.
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:18.512
SOVEREIGN DEBT MARKETS THAT IS
NOT HOW THINGS WORK.

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:21.515
THAT IS HOW CORPORATE DEBT
SECURITIES WOULD WORK.

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:25.519
IF THE PROFITS ARE GOOD, YOUR
BORROWING COSTS WILL BE LOWER.

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.521
THE TREASURY MARKET DOES NOT
WORK LIKE THAT AND THE FEDERAL

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:32.526
RESERVE CERTAINLY DOES NOT WORK
LIKE THAT EITHER.

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:36.530
THIS SET YOU UP FOR MORE
ATTENTION FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD.

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:39.533
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING
INTERVIEWS IN THE LAST MONTH, I

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.535
WOULD LOVE SOME INSIGHT ON
THESE POTENTIAL FOR CANDIDATES

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:44.538
AS THE INTERVIEWS CONTINUE.
ANNMARIE:

01:35:44.538 --> 01:35:49.510
MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME INSIGHT.
RICK RIEDER, A FREQUENT GUEST

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.511
ON BLOOMBERG IS HAVING HIS
INTERVIEW SUPPOSEDLY TOMORROW

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:53.514
WITH THE PRESIDENT.
HE'S THE LAST ONE TO HAVE THE

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:56.517
INTERVIEW.
MAYBE HE CAN SHARE INSIGHT ON

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:58.519
THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED.
NUMBER ONE IS WILL YOU CUT

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:01.522
RATES. JONATHAN:
BEST OF LUCK TO HIM FOR THE

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:13.534
NEXT 25 HOURS.
UP NEXT, WE WILL CATCH UP WITH

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:25.513
ALTY ALTMANN, SARAH HOUSE AND
DAVID RUBENSTEIN OF CARLISLE. ♪

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:36.457
&gt;&gt; THE NEXT A BULLISH CATALYST
TO THE EARNINGS SEASON.

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:43.464
&gt;&gt; EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR
Q4, THE BAR IS LOW.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:45.466
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A MOMENT OF PAUSE.
MAYBE 2026 WILL NOT BE AS

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:48.469
SMOOTH AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
ANTICIPATING.

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:51.472
&gt;&gt; THERE IS STILL ROOM TO RUN
HERE.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.473
&gt;&gt; THIS IS "BLOOMBERG
SURVEILLANCE"

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.475
WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA
ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:56.477
HORDERN. JONATHAN:
LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:37:02.483 line:92%
GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING.

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:05.486
THE THIRD HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG
SURVEILLANCE" STARTS RIGHT NOW.

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:10.457
EQUITY FUTURES PULLING BACK
50.4% ON THE S&amp;P 500.

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:14.461
DOWN BY 0.5 ON THE NASDAQ 100.
EARNINGS FROM CITI ANY MOMENT

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:18.465
NOW.
THEN WE GET DATA, PPI, RETAIL

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:20.467
SALES.
LISA IS SITTING DOWN WITH ED

01:37:20.467 --> 01:37:25.472
BASTIAN.
10:00 EASTERN, WE MAKE GET A

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:30.477
RULING ON THOSE LIBERATION DAY
TARIFFS. ANNMARIE:

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:33.480
THAT WILL BE HUGE FOR THIS
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THEY

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.485
BASICALLY NEED TO WORK ABOUT
75% OF THE TARIFF DEALS WITH

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:42.456
THIS ADMINISTRATION OR
POTENTIALLY THE FENTANYL

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:43.457
TARIFFS THEY HAVE PUT ON OTHER
COUNTRIES, THAT WILL BE

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:48.462
INTERESTING.
THE TIMING OF THIS, THE

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:51.465
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DAVOS,
SEEING THESE COUNTRIES.

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.467
IF HE IS REWORKING THIS, THAT
WILL TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME AND

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:56.637
SPACE FOR THE REST OF HIS
CABINET.

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:59.773
HE SAID YESTERDAY WE HAVE OTHER
WAYS.

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:02.476
TARIFFS IS HIS FAVORITE WORD.
JONATHAN:

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:06.480
THE NUMBERS FROM CITI JUST
DROPPING.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.485
STOCKS FALLING AS TRADERS WAIT
THE LATEST BANK EARNINGS.

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:13.487
THE DELTA CEO CATCHING UP WITH
LISA AFTER THAT UNDERWHELMING

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:14.488
OUTLOOK YESTERDAY.
SARAH HOUSE BREAKING DOWN THE

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:18.459
LATEST DATA.
CITI EARNINGS CROSSING A MOMENT

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:25.466 line:92%
AGO. DANI HAS THE HEADLINES.

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:26.467
DANI:
FOURTH-QUARTER FIXED SALES AND

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:36.477
TRADING REVENUE IS A BEAT.
THAT COMES IN AT 3.40 $6

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.478
BILLION, THE ESTIMATE WAS FOR
$3.29 BILLION.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:43.484
EQUITY SALES AND TREATING COMES
IN LIGHT. JUST OVER $1 BILLION.

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:48.455
THE ESTIMATE WAS FOR $1.1
BILLION.

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:50.457
WE HAD A WARNING FROM THE CFO,
ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT THE

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:54.461
MARKETS REVENUE WOULD BE IN THE
LOW TO MID SINGLE DIGITS.

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:58.465
MAYBE NOT A SURPRISE THAT YOU
HAVE SOME WEAKNESS THERE.

01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:01.468
IT LOOKS LIKE INVESTMENT
BANKING IS SOMEWHAT STRONG,

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:06.473
$1.27 BILLION.
AGGRESSIVE GROWTH THAT CITI IS

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:10.477
AIMING FOR IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER.

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:16.483
JP MORGAN WAS UP BY 6%, SO
PERHAPS A TURNAROUND, HIS

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:19.486
SUGGESTION THAT THE HIRE IS
WORKING FOR CITI.

01:39:19.486 --> 01:39:25.459
SOME OF THESE OTHER METRICS
COMING IN A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:27.461
BUT JANE FRASER SAYING WE
ENTERED 2026 WITH VISIBLE

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:30.464
MOMENTUM ACROSS THE FIRM,
COMMITTING TO A RETURN ON

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:38.472
EQUITY OF 10% TO 11%.
TOTAL COST OF CREDIT IS 2.2

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:43.477
BILLION DOLLARS, LIGHTER THAN
ESTIMATES OF $2.5 BILLION.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.478
LET'S ADD IN THIS GROUP FROM
BLOOMBERG, LETTING GO OF

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:51.485 line:92%
THOUSAND PEOPLE THIS WEEK.

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:55.456
IN ORDER FOR CITI TO L HIT ITS
TARGET, IT WOULD NEED TO LET

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.457
MORE FOLKS GO TO GET ITS
HEADCOUNT TARGETS.

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:59.460
IT IS LOOKING MIXED.
MAYBE THAT IS WHY WE ARE SEEING

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:04.465
THE MARKET REACTION.
AT THE MOMENT UNCHANGED.

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:07.468
BUT THEY ARE SEEING A LOWER
LEVEL OF SEVERANCE IN 2026, SO

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:11.472
MAYBE THE IMPLEMENT PICTURE
WILL START TO NORMALIZE.

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:15.476
JONATHAN:
SIMILAR TO JP MORGAN YESTERDAY,

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:16.477
POCKETS OF WEAKNESS, POCKETS OF
STRENGTH AGAINST A RELATIVELY

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:23.484
HIGH BAR.
THEN WE GET TO THE CALL.

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:24.485
THE MEDIA GETS ON THE CALL,
THEY SKIP PAST THE NUMBERS AND

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:27.488
GO STRAIGHT TO THE POLICY AND
POLITICS.

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:32.459
WHAT ARE WE HERE AND ELSEWHERE?
DANI:

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:37.464
BANK OF AMERICA DECLINED TO
COMMENT.

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:40.467
THE WELLS FARGO CEO SAID THAT
THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WOULD

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:41.468
AFFECT A WIDE SPECTRUM OF
PEOPLE, WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:47.474
IMPACT FROM THE THREAT OF THAT.
JUST TO BE CLEAR, AS WE HAD

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:53.480
WITH JP MORGAN, AS WE HAD WITH
BANK OF AMERICA, THEY ARE AT

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.481
PAINS TO BEGIN THE ANSWER BY
SAYING WE SUPPORT THE

01:40:54.481 --> 01:41:00.487
AFFORDABILITY PUSH.
THE CFO SAYING FAMILIES ACROSS

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:03.457
THE COUNTRY HAVING HAVING
ISSUES WITH THE PORTABILITY FOR

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:07.161
SOME TIME AND WE THINK ABOUT
DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO COMBAT

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:10.464
THE PROBLEM.
HE GOES ON TO SAY, IT WOULD

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:13.467
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE
IMPACT FOR CREDIT AVAILABILITY

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:16.470
FOR A WIDE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE
AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:21.475
ECONOMIC GROWTH, NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON THE INDUSTRY, TOO.

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:24.478
AS EXPECTED, THE COMMENTS ARE
NOT POSITIVE. JONATHAN:

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:29.483
THANK YOU.
LOOK OUT FOR DANI ALONGSIDE

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:31.485
MATT MILLER.
RULE NUMBER ONE OF BANKING,

01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:34.488
NEVER UPSET THE PERSON WITH
THEIR FINGER ON THE REGULATIONS.

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:38.459
ANNMARIE:
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT CITI

01:41:38.459 --> 01:41:42.463
HAS TO SAY ABOUT CREDIT CARDS.
REPRESENTING 23% OF LOANS.

01:41:42.463 --> 01:41:46.467
CAN THEY EVEN MAKE MONEY IF
THERE CAP IS UNDER 10%?

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:49.470
JONATHAN:
GOLDMAN REPORTING TOMORROW,

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.471
DOWN 0.4 PERCENT.
WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM IN

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:55.476
MORGAN STANLEY.
ALEX ALTMANN OF BARCLAYS

01:41:55.476 --> 01:42:01.482
WRITING, INVESTORS WILL HAVE TO
NAVIGATE THE NOISE, UPCOMING Q4

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:05.486
EARNINGS, AND TRY TO DEPLOY
CAPITAL INTO THEMES THAT SHOULD

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:07.488
BE AGNOSTIC INTO THE WHIP SONG
HEADLINES. EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:13.460 line:92%
TELL ME HOW TO DO THAT. ALEX:

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.463
KEEP IT REALLY SIMPLE, AS
SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:20.467
THEMATICALLY, AS FAR AS WE AS A
TEAM ARE CONCERNED, THERE IS

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.468
ONE OBVIOUS THEME WHICH YOU CAN
DEPLOY IN A LOT OF WAYS, THE

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:27.474
U.S.-CHINA DECOUPLING.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:31.478
THAT WILL BE HUMMING IN THE
BACKGROUND.

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:37.484
AT THE CENTER OF THAT, YOU'VE
GOT TOPICS LIKE DEFENSE,

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:41.488
COMMODITIES, SECURITY, U.S.
HEGEMONY.

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:43.457
WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE COMMODITY
ANGLE.

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:46.627
WE THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE
MOST INTERESTING THEMES I'VE

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.462
SEEN. JONATHAN:
WE ARE SEEING METALS THIS

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:52.466
MORNING.
NOT JUST PRECIOUS METALS BUT

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:58.472
YOU ARE SEEING IT IN COPPER,
TIN. ALEX:

01:42:58.472 --> 01:42:59.473
WE HAVE SEEN A PRECIOUS METAL
RALLY HAVING TO DO WITH

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:04.478
DEBASEMENT.
INDUSTRIAL METALS OR SOMETHING

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:06.480
THAT WE PIVOTED QUITE HARD TO
IN THE FOURTH QUARTER LAST YEAR

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:13.487 line:92%
BECAUSE OF THE DECOUPLING. U.S.

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:14.488
AND CHINA USED TO BE
CODEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER,

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:21.461 line:92%
STILL ON A LOT OF RESOURCES.

01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:26.466
IF WE ARE MOVING TO DECOUPLING,
WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY GOT TWO

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:29.469
YEARS FOR THESE COUNTRIES TO
SECURE AS MUCH RESOURCE AS

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:30.470
POSSIBLE, NOT JUST PHYSICAL
DEMAND BUT LINE OF SIGHT ON

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:36.476
FUTURE SUPPLY.
WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:39.479
THAT, THE U.S.
IS RELYING ON OVER 50% IMPORTS

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:45.485 line:92%
OF METALS.

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:46.486
NOT JUST RARE EARTH, COPPER,
ELECTORAL SYSTEMS, ALUMINUM,

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:50.457
EVERYTHING. ANNMARIE:
COULD WE SEE MORE NOISE WHEN IT

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:54.461
COMES TO GEOPOLITICS?
THE PRESIDENT CAPTURED MADURO,

01:43:54.461 --> 01:43:59.466
NOW TALKING ABOUT GREENLAND.
ALEX:

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:03.470
LET'S NOT EXCLUDE UKRAINE AS
WELL, MASSIVE MINERALS.

01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:07.474
A LOT OF THE FOREIGN POLICY
DECISIONS ARE BEING DRIVEN BY

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:12.479
THOSE TWO FACTORS, DEFENSE AND
COMMODITY SECURITY. ANNMARIE:

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:15.482
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE
AI TRADE, BUILDING OUT DATA

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:17.484
CENTERS OR TO INCREASE THE
AVAILABILITY OF THESE METALS

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:24.458
AND MINERALS FOR OUR MILITARY?
ALEX: IT IS BOTH OF THOSE.

01:44:24.458 --> 01:44:27.461
IF YOU WANT TO BUILD
INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS AND

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:30.464
BRIDGES, ELECTRIFICATION OF THE
GRID, MODERNIZE YOUR ECONOMY,

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:32.466
YOU NEED ACCESS TO CRITICAL
MINERALS AND METALS.

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:35.469
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE AI
NARRATIVE.

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:41.475
IT'S AN IMPORTANT INCREMENTAL
DEMAND FOR COPPER, BUT WE ARE

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:43.477
TALKING ABOUT 5% COMING FROM
DATA CENTERS.

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:48.482
CHINA IS ACCOUNTING FOR 60% OF
GLOBAL COPPER DEMAND. JONATHAN:

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:52.486
SOME OF THOSE METALS ARE
ALREADY TRADING AT ALL-TIME

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:53.487
HIGHS, GOLD, SILVER, COPPER.
RECORD HIGHS IN THE BANKING

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:59.459 line:92%
SECTOR AS WELL.

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:01.461
WE HAVE SEEN SOME PUSHBACK FROM
EARNINGS SEASON.

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:05.465
I WONDER IF YOU ARE TAKING ANY
EARLY INDICATORS FROM THE WAY

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:09.369
THE STOCK HAS BEHAVED IN THE
WAY WE HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:11.471
PAST THREE OR FOUR HOURS.
FINANCIALS. ALEX:

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:12.472
YOU HAVE THIS NOISE AROUND THE
CREDIT CARD DATA, WHICH YOU

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:16.476
HAVE ALREADY COVERED.
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THERE

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:22.482 line:92%
ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:23.483
WILL HAPPEN IN THE ECM WORLD IN
2026, ALSO QUESTIONS AROUND THE

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:28.488
STATE OF THE CONSUMER.
PEOPLE THINK IT WILL BE A

01:45:28.488 --> 01:45:33.460
ROBUST BACKDROP, BUT WE ARE
STILL IN THE K-SHAPED RECOVERY.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.461
A LARGE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS
THAT ARE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE AND

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:40.467
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THOSE.
JONATHAN:

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.469
DOES IT MAKE IT EASIER TO TRADE
SMALL CAPS, TO BE INVESTED IN

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:43.470
SMALL CAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT
A TARGET OF THE HEADLINES TO

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:49.476
START THE NEW YEAR? ALEX:
WE HAVE BEEN VERY BULLISH ON

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:51.478
SMALL CAPS SINCE JULY OF LAST
YEAR.

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:53.480
WE ARE BEGINNING TO TEMPER THAT
ENTHUSIASM NOW. JONATHAN:

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:59.486 line:92%
WHAT HAS CHANGED? ALEX:

01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:06.460
POSITIONING WAS A BIG DRIVER OF
OUR REVIEW.

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.462
NOW THAT HAS MOVED TO A NET
LONG.

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:15.469
ONE OF THE BIG BENEFICIARIES OF
SMALL CAPS RIGHT NOW IS THE

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:17.471
COMBINATION OF THE OBBB AND AI
BENEFICIARIES, COMPANIES

01:46:17.471 --> 01:46:21.475
STARTED TO GET THE BENEFITS OF
AI PRODUCTS.

01:46:21.475 --> 01:46:23.477
THERE IS A POSITIVE SMALL-CAP
STORY BUT FROM THE DYNAMIC

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:28.482
PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE TO RESPECT
THAT IT HAS CHANGED. JONATHAN:

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:31.485
DID SOMETHING QUICK AND IN THE
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, AWAY FROM

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:37.457
THE FEDERAL RESERVE STORY?
THE FACT THAT WE HAD SMALL CAPS

01:46:37.457 --> 01:46:38.458
RALLY AS HARD AS THEY DID, EVEN
THOUGH THE RATE CUTTING CYCLE

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:44.464 line:92%
IS NOW STALLED. ALEX:

01:46:44.464 --> 01:46:45.465
I WOULD SAY THERE IS A TARIFF
TEMPERAMENT AT PLAY IN SMALL

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:49.469
CAPS.
WE WILL GET THE ANNOUNCEMENT

01:46:49.469 --> 01:46:52.472
FROM THE SUPREME COURT ANY DAY
NOW.

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:53.473
THAT DECISION WILL ALSO PLOT
THE PATH FOR SMALL CAPS.

JONATHAN: IS THAT A STORY?

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.482
ANNMARIE HAS ASKED THE QUESTION
CONTINUOUSLY.

01:47:02.482 --> 01:47:04.484
BASICALLY, IT GOES, BUT WILL
HAPPENED IS THEY WILL FIND

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:09.456
ANOTHER WAY AND IT WILL NOT
CHANGE ANYTHING. ALEX:

01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:12.459
THE QUESTION IS NOT ABOUT
WHETHER IT IS A MARKET DYNAMIC

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:16.329
OR NOT, THE QUESTION IS DOES
THE PRESIDENT WANT TO USE HIS

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:20.200
IEEPA SCOTUS RULING IN A YEAR
WHERE HE REALLY WANTS TO WIN

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.469
THE MIDTERMS?
A LOT OF THE POLICY

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:26.473
ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT HAVE COME
THROUGH FROM HIM OVER THE PAST

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:30.477
WEEK HAVE BEEN ABOUT
AFFORDABILITY AND HELPING THE

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:34.481
MIDDLE CLASS, SO IT A TARIFF
ROLLBACK -- AND WE HAVE SEEN

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:39.486
SOME OF THAT IN FURNITURE,
KITCHEN CABINETRY -- IS THIS

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:41.488
ALL PART OF A ONE-YEAR HIATUS
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.456
AFFORDABILITY DYNAMIC OF
AMERICANS AND THEN KICK THE

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:47.461
TARIFF NARRATIVE BACK IN?
THAT IS NOT MY VIEW. ANNMARIE:

01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:50.597
SO BLAME THE SUPREME COURT?
ALEX:

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:55.802
I THINK THE PRESIDENT LIKES
TARIFFS, LIKES USING IT AS

01:47:55.802 --> 01:48:00.474
LEVERAGE IN FOREIGN POLICY.
HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL A

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:03.477
NARRATIVE THAT THERE IS AN
OFFER THAT COULD PRESENT ITSELF.

01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:08.482
JONATHAN: A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
ALEX ALTMANN OF BARCLAYS.

THINK THE MACRO NUMBERS WILL

SHAKE THIS EQUITY MARKET.

LET'S TURN TO THE AIRLINES.

01:50:43.269 --> 01:50:44.270
DELTA IS FIRST TO REPORT
FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS.

01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:51.277
LISA IS AT DELTA HEADQUARTERS
IN ATLANTA WITH A SPECIAL

01:50:51.277 --> 01:50:54.280
GUEST. HEY, LISA. LISA: THANK
YOU SO MUCH.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.282
WE KNOW YOUR OBSESSION WITH
RIVIAN, EXPECT TO BE DRIVING

01:50:56.282 --> 01:51:00.286
ONE.
I'M IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA WITH

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:04.290
THE CEO OF DELTA ED BASTIAN
ALONGSIDE ME AFTER THAT

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:08.294
EARNINGS REPORT, 20% PROJECTION
IN 2026.

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:10.296
NOW THAT YOU HAD A DAY TO
DIGEST, HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:11.297
BY THE MARKET REACTION, THE
LINES OF INQUIRY THAT YOU GOT

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:20.273
YESTERDAY? ED: NOT REALLY.
FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR COMING.

01:51:20.273 --> 01:51:22.275
GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE CAMPUS
IN ATLANTA.

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:24.277
A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS, WE HAVE
A LOT OF MOMENTUM GOING INTO

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:28.281
THE BUSINESS.
WE SEE THE FIRST PART OF THE

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:32.285
YEAR THE MOMENTUM PICKED UP
AGAIN, EARLY DAYS OF JANUARY.

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:35.288
AS A RESULT OF THAT, OUR
INVESTOR BASE WAS CURIOUS

01:51:35.288 --> 01:51:38.291
WHETHER THEY SEE THAT MOMENTUM
CONTINUING TO BUILD, FLATLINED,

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:44.297
POP AROUND A LITTLE BIT.
WE JUST FINISHED A YEAR WHERE

01:51:44.297 --> 01:51:47.300
WE SAW SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT
CHALLENGES, WHETHER IT WAS THE

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.269
LIBERATION DAY IMPACT ON
CONSUMER SENTIMENT, SHUT DOWN

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:53.273
OF THE GOVERNMENT, AIRSPACE AND
THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR.

01:51:53.273 --> 01:51:57.277
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
HAD SOME WIGGLE ROOM, CAUTION

01:51:57.277 --> 01:52:00.280
AS TO HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT
PROJECTING THE YEAR OUT.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.284
THEY WERE MORE INCREASE AS TO
HOW MUCH CAUTION IS THERE, WHAT

01:52:04.284 --> 01:52:10.290
COULD GREAT LOOK LIKE?
THAT IS MORE OF WHAT WE SAW.

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:12.292
LISA:
WE WILL GET INTO WHAT GREAT

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:16.296
COULD LOOK LIKE.
LET'S GET INTO SOME THINGS THAT

01:52:16.296 --> 01:52:19.299
ARE LESS FORESEEABLE INCLUDING
A PROPOSED 10% CAP ON CREDIT

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:23.269
CARD RATES.
IT RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:27.273
THE LOYALTY PROGRAM AT DELTA,
CONSIDERING AMERICAN EXPRESS

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:29.275
AND PARTNERSHIP THERE
CONTRIBUTED SOMETHING LIKE 14%

01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:30.276
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS OF
THE REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE

01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:34.280
PAST YEAR.
HOW BIG OF A HIT IS THIS, HAVE

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:42.288
YOU STARTED TO MAP THAT OUT? ED:
I THINK IT IS EARLY, PREMATURE.

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:44.958
THAT IS NOT OUR BUSINESS, THE
FINANCIAL SERVICES WORLD.

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:47.627
THE BANKS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN
ABOUT IT, EXPRESSING A

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:50.296
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONCERN.
I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD REQUIRE

01:52:50.296 --> 01:52:53.299
LEGISLATION IS WHAT I'M TOLD.
WE KNOW THE CHALLENGES OF

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:57.270
GETTING ANYTHING THROUGH
CONGRESS THESE DAYS.

01:52:57.270 --> 01:53:02.275
I ALSO THINK THE KNOCK ON
EFFECTS ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:08.281
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT SEEMS
TO BE MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO

01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:12.285
HELP LOWER INCOME STRATA, SOME
INTEREST-RATE RELIEF.

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:17.290
REALITY IS, IT WILL ELIMINATE
THEIR ABILITY FOR CREDIT, FREES

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:18.291
UP TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF CREDIT
LINES THAT THE BANKS WILL NOT

01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:23.296
BE ABLE TO AFFORD.
IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS.

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:30.270
OF COURSE, WE WILL WORK CLOSELY
WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS.

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:33.273
THE SECOND THING IS, AMEX IS A
PREMIUM CAR PROVIDER, SO THAT

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:34.274
IS NOT REALLY THAT INCOME LEVEL
THAT WE FOCUS ON IN OUR

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:41.281
BUSINESS. LISA:
THERE IS A SENSE THAT IT IS A

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:45.285
GROWING PART OF THE REVENUES,
THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT MADE TO

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:47.287
DELTA'S REVENUES, SO I WONDER
HOW MUCH DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO

01:53:47.287 --> 01:53:54.294
GROW ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL? ED:
WE EXPECT HIGH SINGLE DIGIT

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:56.296
GROWTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR, WE
HAVE SEEN LOW DOUBLE DIGIT

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:59.299
GROWTH THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.
IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:04.270
OUR BUSINESS MODEL BUT IT IS
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK BACK

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:05.271
AND GETTING -- THIS IDEA HAS A
LOT OF ROADBLOCKS AND OBSTACLES

01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:10.276
AHEAD OF IT. LISA:
ONE THING YOU SAID IN AN

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:13.279
INTERVIEW WITH A COLLEAGUE,
WHAT COULD GREAT LOOK LIKE, ALL

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:16.282
THE GROWTH THAT YOU HAVE SEEN
SO FAR IS FROM THE PREMIUM

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:23.289
CABIN, NOT THE MAIN CABIN.
IS THAT BECAUSE OF INCREDIBLE

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:30.296
STRENGTH AT THE PREMIUM END OR
WEAKNESS IN THE MAIN CABIN? ED:

01:54:30.296 --> 01:54:32.298
DEMAND FOR THE PREMIUM PRODUCTS
THAT WE OFFER CONTINUES TO BE

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:35.301
AT A RECORD HIGH.
THE MORE THAT WE LOOK AT THE

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:44.277
HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER, WE TALK
ABOUT THE K, WE ARE AT THE TOP

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:46.279
END OF THE K, IN TERMS OF WHO
OUR CONSUMER IS.

01:54:46.279 --> 01:54:47.280
THAT IS WHAT DRIVES THE GROWTH
THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.284
SEVERAL YEARS.
THAT SAID ON THE MAIN CABIN,

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:59.292
STILL A BIG PART OF OUR
BUSINESS, PAYS THE BILLS.

01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:05.298
AS WE SEE SOME OF THE
RATIONALIZATION OCCURRING

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:10.270
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF LOWER
END AIRLINES CHASING TOO MANY

01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:11.271
SEATS, CONSUMER DEMAND, THAT
SPACE IS WHERE A LOT OF THE

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:16.276
RATIONALIZATION IS IN THE
INDUSTRY CURRENTLY.

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:19.279
AS THAT BACKDROP CONTINUES TO
GET INTO A HEALTHIER

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:22.849
ENVIRONMENT -- BECAUSE ALL OF
THOSE AIRLINES HAVE TO FIND A

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:27.487
WAY TO EARN THEIR WAY, COST OF
CAPITAL OR THEY WILL NOT BE

01:55:27.487 --> 01:55:29.289
AROUND.
WHATEVER HAPPENED THERE, WE

01:55:29.289 --> 01:55:30.290
WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT AND WE
WILL KEEP THAT PREMIUM DEMAND

01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:34.294
SENT GROWING.
WE ARE NOT GROWING IN THAT

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:37.297
SPACE BUT IT WILL STILL BE A
GOOD ONE FOR US. LISA:

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:42.302
YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT
CONSOLIDATION IN THE LOWER END

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:45.271
OF THE INDUSTRY AS PEOPLE TRY
TO SURVIVE.

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:49.275
WOULD YOU PLAY IN THAT IN ANY
WAY, MAKE ANY ACQUISITIONS? ED:

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:52.278
WE WILL NOT COMMENT ON THAT
QUESTION, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:58.284
WHAT DELTA IS, YOU CAN ANSWER
THE QUESTION FOR YOURSELF. LISA:

01:55:58.284 --> 01:55:59.285
THE OTHER QUESTION IS HOW MUCH
GROWTH WILL COME FROM ORGANIC

01:55:59.285 --> 01:56:04.190
VERSUS INORGANIC?
IS THERE A PLAN GIVEN HOW MUCH

01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:09.095
YOU HAVE REDUCED LEVERAGE TO
INCREASE BY ACQUISITIONS SOME

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:11.297 line:92%
OF YOUR CAPACITY? ED:

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:15.301
INTERNATIONAL IS A BIG PART OF
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:16.269
WE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY A NEW
ORDER FOR THE BOEING DREAMLINER.

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:20.273
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT OUR

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:26.279
INDUSTRY, THEY SAY WHERE IS THE
FUTURE FOR TRAUMA GOING TO COME

01:56:26.279 --> 01:56:27.246 line:92%
FROM? IT IS INTERNATIONAL.

01:56:27.246 --> 01:56:30.350
ONLY ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD HAVE EVER STEPPED ON AN

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:32.285
AIRPLANE.
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO FIND NEW

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:34.287
OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW AND
EXPAND.

01:56:34.287 --> 01:56:38.558
THAT WILL BE THE STATEMENT OF
THE SECOND CENTURY, ABOUT

01:56:38.558 --> 01:56:43.296
MAKING THE WORLD A MUCH MORE
CONNECTED PLACE THAN IT IS

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:46.299
TODAY. LISA:
THIS COMES AT A TIME,

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:48.301
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL GROWTH,
WHERE THE RHETORIC BETWEEN

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:54.273
COUNTRIES HAS BECOME MORE HE,
PUTTING UP WALLS.

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:56.275
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT COULD
CREATE BARRIERS WHEN YOU TALK

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:57.276
ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL,
THE GROWTH YOU ARE SEEING IN

01:56:57.276 --> 01:57:05.284 line:92%
THAT SECTOR? ED:

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:07.286
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LAWS AND
POLITICS.

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:09.288
THE ONE THING THAT REALLY DOES
UNITE THE WORLD IS WHEN YOU CAN

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:13.292
ACTUALLY TRAVEL AND SEE AND
EXPERIENCE GET TO KNOW PEOPLE.

01:57:13.292 --> 01:57:18.297
YOU BRING THE COUNTRY'S
PHYSICALLY CLOSER TOGETHER.

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:20.299
YES, IT WILL NOT BE A STRAIGHT
LINE UP.

01:57:20.299 --> 01:57:23.269
IN THIS BUSINESS, WE KNOW THERE
IS A LOT OF TURBULENCE IN THE

01:57:23.302 --> 01:57:26.272
SKY, NOT JUST IN THE BUSINESS
MODEL SOMETIMES.

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:31.110
BUT WHEN WE DO GET PHYSICALLY
CONNECTED BACK TOGETHER AND THE

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:35.948
WORLD STARTS TO BECOME A CLOSER
PLACE, THAT IS WHERE REAL

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:37.283 line:92%
OPPORTUNITY SITS. LISA:

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:39.285
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
DEMAND, SEEING RECORD DEMAND IN

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:43.289
THE FIRST WEEK AND A HALF OF
JANUARY.

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:49.295
IS IT MOSTLY COMING FROM
PREMIUM, IS IT EQUAL ACROSS ALL

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.296
TIERS, IS IT EQUAL IN ECONOMY,
THE ROBUST INTEREST THAT YOU

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:56.269
ARE SEEING AT THE TOP END? ED:
IT CONTINUES TO BE IN BUSINESS.

01:57:56.302 --> 01:58:00.273
DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN BUSINESS
TO START THE YEAR.

01:58:00.273 --> 01:58:03.276
WE HAD OUR LARGEST WEEKLY SALES
IN HISTORY LAST WEEK, DOUBLE

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:05.278
DIGITS OVER THE SAME WEEK A
YEAR AGO.

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:07.280

I HAVE TO END WITH THIS, THE
LOUNGES, THEY ARE GETTING

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:19.292
REALLY CROWDED.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:25.298
THAT, GIVEN PEOPLE HAVE HAD
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT. ED:

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:31.270
IT IS A PROBLEM OF NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED.

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:32.271
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THERE,
DOESN'T FEEL EXCLUSIVE ANY

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:35.274
LONGER.
WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT.

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:38.277
AMERICAN EXPRESS IS BUILDING
NEW LOUNGES, WE HAVE THE DELTA

01:58:38.277 --> 01:58:42.281
ONE LOUNGES COMING.
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:43.282
BUILD MORE SUPPLY AND CAPACITY
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

LISA:

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:52.291
MARIA CORINA ED BASTIAN, THANK
YOU. APPRECIATE YOU SITTING DOWN

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:54.293
WITH US.
HE DID SAY THAT HE WOULD

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:59.298
ADDRESS THE LOUNGE ISSUE.
JONATHAN:

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:00.299
WE NEED SOMETHING FROM NEW YORK.
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:59:00.299 --> 01:59:07.273 line:92%
CAN FIGURE OUT? LISA:

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:08.274
I WILL PUT IN THE REQUEST.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:12.278
LISA WITH THE LATEST ON THE
GROUND FROM DELTA AIRLINES.

01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:18.284
HOW ABOUT A ROUTE INTO SARDINIA?
ANNMARIE:

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:19.285
EVERYONE IS SO EXCITED ABOUT
SICILY, THE SERIES, "WHITE

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:24.290
LOTUS."
THERE IS SOMEONE TRAVELING

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:30.296
DIRECTLY TO BARI. JONATHAN:
THE LATEST ON DELTA THERE.

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:34.000
THE HEADLINE, THE TAKE AWAY
FROM THAT COMPANY STORY, HOW

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.703
WELL THE PREMIUM CABIN IS
DOING, HOW SOFT THINGS ARE

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:40.273
ELSEWHERE.
WE ARE SEEING THAT IN THE

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:45.278
ECONOMY WHICH IS WHY I, THE
DELTA AIRLINES ECONOMY.

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:46.279
HALF THE COUNTRY THINKS IT IS
GROUP ONE, AND THE OTHER HALF

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:51.284
IS STRUGGLING. ANNMARIE:
THEY ARE PUTTING THE MONEY INTO

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:54.287
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN
AFFORD IT.

01:59:54.287 --> 02:00:00.293
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE A
LOWERCASE I.

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:06.299
IT IS EVERYONE AND THEN A SMALL
TOP 10% AT THE TOP. JONATHAN:

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:08.301
COMING UP, DATA, PPI, RETAIL
SALES.

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:11.270
CATCHING UP WITH SARAH HOUSE
FROM WELLS FARGO.

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:17.276
FROM NEW YORK CITY, YOU ARE
WATCHING BLOOMBERG TV.

♪

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:37.730
JONATHAN:
THE OPENING BELL ABOUT 60

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:42.535
MINUTES AWAY.
EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&amp;P DOWN

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:47.540
BY NEGATIVE 3% -- 0.3 PERCENT.
ECONOMIC DATA SECONDS AWAY.

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.544
ANOTHER READ ON INFLATION WITH
PPI AND RETAIL SALES IN AMERICA.

02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:55.548
IN THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS
STILL ARRANGE BROWN.

02:00:55.548 --> 02:01:01.554
BOND YIELDS LOWER BY TWO BASIS
POINTS.

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:06.525
WITH THE LATEST DATA, LET'S
CROSS OVER TO MIKE MCKEE. MIKE:

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:09.528
WE WILL SEE IF WE CANNOT MOVE
THE NEEDLE A LITTLE OF IT FOR

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:12.531
THE EQUITY MARKETS WITH RETAIL
SALES COMING IN UP .6% AFTER

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:17.536
BEING FLAT, THAT'S THE HEADLINE.
FLAT IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER.

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:21.540
THESE ARE NOVEMBER NUMBERS, SO
WE ARE BEHIND BECAUSE OF THE

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:25.544
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
EX AUTOS, UP HALF A PERCENT

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:29.548
AFTER A 0.4 GAIN.
EX AUTOS AND GAS, UP ZERO .4 AS

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:36.555
WELL.
THE CONTROL GROUP, WHICH WE

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:37.556
CARE ABOUT, UP 0.4%, DOWN FROM
A 0.6 PERCENT GAIN REVISED

02:01:37.556 --> 02:01:41.527
LOWER FROM THE MONTH OF OCTOBER.
PPI NUMBERS ARE NOT OUT YET,

02:01:41.527 --> 02:01:48.534 line:92%
SLOW TO COME OUT. HERE WE GO.

02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:52.538
PRODUCER PRICE INCREASED 0.2%
IN NOVEMBER.

02:01:52.538 --> 02:01:54.540
SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER NUMBERS
BECAUSE THERE WERE NO OCTOBER

02:01:54.540 --> 02:02:00.546 line:92%
NUMBERS JUST LIKE WITH CPI.

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:02.548
PPI FOR THE YEAR, LET'S SEE IF
YOU HAVE AN ANNUALIZED BASIS

02:02:02.548 --> 02:02:04.550
NUMBER.
3% FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED IN

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:10.556 line:92%
NOVEMBER. THAT IS THE HEADLINE.

02:02:10.556 --> 02:02:17.530
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE CORE,
WHICH WE USUALLY CONSIDER THE

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:21.534
NEXT TRADE ONE, INDEX FOR FINAL
DEMAND, UP 0.2% IN NOVEMBER.

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:27.540
FOR THE YEAR, UP 3.5%.
THAT IS THE LARGEST 12-MONTH

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:33.546
INCREASE SINCE RISING 3.5% IN
MARCH.

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:36.549
ON THE BASIS OF THE PPI ANNUAL
FIGURES, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WILL

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:40.553
NOT BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES
ANYTIME SOON, AND WITH

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:42.555
RELATIVELY STRONG RETAIL SALES,
IT SEEMS LIKE INFLATION IS

02:02:42.555 --> 02:02:46.559
STILL GOING TO BE ON THE MENU.
JONATHAN:

02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:52.531
AS YOU INDICATED, SOMEWHAT
DATED DATA, BUT DO WE HAVE A

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:56.535
DECENT PICTURE OF THE OVERALL
ECONOMY? MIKE:

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:59.538
PROBABLY NOT IN TERMS OF THE
DATA THAT COMES IN FOR THE

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:03.542
OVERALL ECONOMY, BUT IT GIVES
US A DIRECTION.

02:03:03.542 --> 02:03:04.543
THE JANUARY MEETING, THEY HAVE
SAID THEY PROBABLY WILL NOT BE

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:07.546
CUTTING.
I WOULD IMAGINE THIS KIND OF

02:03:07.546 --> 02:03:11.550
DATA SEALS THAT.
TWO OR THREE MORE REPORTS ON

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:14.553
THESE THINK BEFORE THE NEXT
MEETING IN MARCH.

02:03:14.553 --> 02:03:15.554
THEY WILL HAVE A MUCH CLEANER
READ BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:27.533
END OF THE FIRST QUARTER.
QUICKLY HERE, MOTOR VEHICLE

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:28.534
SALES WERE UP BY A PERCENT,
FURNITURE DOWN 0.1 PERCENT,

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:38.544 line:92%
BUILDING MATERIALS UP 1.3%.

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:41.547
WE SAW IN CPI, GROCERY PRICE
INDEXES WENT UP.

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:42.548
SINCE ALL OF THIS IS CALCULATED
ON A DOLLAR BASIS, THAT'S

02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:50.556
INTERESTING.
CLOTHING STORES UP 0.9%.

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:53.526
DEPARTMENT STORES DOWN 2.9.
GENERAL MERCHANDISE FLAT.

02:03:53.559 --> 02:03:55.528
THESE ARE NOVEMBER NUMBERS, SO
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN BLACK

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:59.532
FRIDAY NUMBERS.
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE AS GOOD

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.534
AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HOPED FOR
THAT PERIOD OF TIME IN TERMS OF

02:04:01.534 --> 02:04:06.539
HOLIDAY GIFTS. JONATHAN:
STANDBY, I WILL GET TO THE

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:07.540
PRICE ACTION.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.543
RESERVE.
EQUITY FUTURES PRETTY MUCH

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:18.551
UNMOVED.
THE BOND MARKET, LOOKING ACROSS

02:04:18.551 --> 02:04:19.552
THE YIELD CURVE, STILL LOWER BY
A BASIS POINT OR TWO ACROSS THE

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:27.526 line:92%
CURVE. FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:31.530
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE UNIVERSAL PUSHBACK WE HAVE

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:35.534
SEEN TWO DEVELOPMENTS AROUND
THE FEDERAL RESERVE OVER THE

02:04:35.534 --> 02:04:38.537
PAST FEW DAYS, TO SEE ALL OF
THESE CENTRAL BANKERS SIGNED ON

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:42.541
TO THE SAME NOTE TO PAYMENT
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:45.544
MIKE:
CENTRAL BANKERS ARE LOOKING AT

02:04:45.544 --> 02:04:49.548
THIS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF
WHAT IS GOOD FOR THEMSELVES IS

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:50.549
HAVING THE FED BE INDEPENDENT
AND NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:56.555
ANY POLITICIAN.
IF THE FED IS MOVING INTEREST

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:57.556
RATES AROUND, IT WILL AFFECT
PEOPLE'S CURRENCIES, AND THAT

02:04:57.556 --> 02:05:00.526
WILL AFFECT THEIR ECONOMIES.
THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN

02:05:00.559 --> 02:05:07.533
THIS.
NEEL KASHKARI, IN AN INTERVIEW

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:11.537
WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES, SAYS
THAT JAY POWELL IS RIGHT, THIS

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:14.540
IS ABOUT MONETARY POLICY, THE
PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS, AND THAT

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:18.544
JAY POWELL EXPLAINED THE
SITUATION ACCURATELY.

02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:23.549
HE DOESN'T SEE ANY IMPETUS TO
CUT IN JANUARY.

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:28.554
A LITTLE BIT OF OTHER NEWS,
FRENCH HILL, CHAIRMAN OF THE

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:29.555
HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES
COMMITTEE, SAYS THAT HE

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:34.527
ANTICIPATES JAY POWELL WILL NOT
COME UP TO THE HILL TO TESTIFY

02:05:34.527 --> 02:05:37.530
FOR THE HOUSE AND SENATE IN
WHAT WE CALL THE HUMPHREY

02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:42.535
HAWKINS TESTIMONY BECAUSE OF
THE PRESIDENT'S INVESTIGATION.

02:05:42.535 --> 02:05:44.537
JONATHAN:
THERE IS SOME TENSION BUILDING,

02:05:44.537 --> 02:05:51.544
AND HAS BEEN FOR THE YEAR.
A LOT OF FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:52.545
SIGNED ON TO A LETTER TO DEFEND
CHAIRMAN POWELL AND THE

02:05:52.545 --> 02:05:55.548
INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL
RESERVE.

02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:58.551
THESE CENTRAL BANKS ARE STILL
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE GOVERNMENTS

02:05:58.551 --> 02:06:02.555
THEY ARE IN, THE COUNTRIES THEY
ARE PLACED IN.

02:06:02.555 --> 02:06:05.558
THIS WAS INTERESTING, WATCHING
THIS PLAY OUT IN NEW ZEALAND.

02:06:05.558 --> 02:06:09.528
THE PRIME MINISTER CAME UP WITH
A NOTE.

02:06:09.528 --> 02:06:11.530
THE NEW ZEALAND CENTRAL BANK
GOVERNORS SIGNED ON TO THAT

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:16.535
SAME LETTER AND THIS IS WITH
THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO SAY.

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:20.539
WE SHOULD NOT INVOLVE OURSELVES
IN U.S. DOMESTIC POLITICS.

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:21.540
WE REMIND THE GOVERNMENT TO
STAY IN HER LINE AND STICK TO

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:26.545
DOMESTIC MONETARY POLICY.
ANNMARIE:

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:28.547
BASICALLY SAYING FROM THE
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER, DO

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:34.553
NOT WADE INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY'S
DOMESTIC POLITICS.

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:38.557
HE PUT IT PRETTY BLUNTLY, STAY
IN YOUR LANE.

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:41.527
THIS IS AN EXPORT HEAVY ECONOMY.
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE

02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:45.531
CROSSFIRE AS OF THIS PRESIDENT
AS THEY DEAL WITH TRADE ISSUES.

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:48.534
A LOT OF THESE CENTRAL BANKERS
SEEMED EXCITED TO SIGN UP FOR

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:52.538
THE LIST. THE ECB WAS THERE,
THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK, BUT

02:06:52.538 --> 02:06:55.541
THIS IS ONE PLACE WHERE THE
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER IS

02:06:55.541 --> 02:06:58.544
SAYING, THAT IS NOT YOUR ROLE,
THIS IS MY ROLE WITH THE UNITED

02:06:58.544 --> 02:07:02.548
STATES.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED UP

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:03.549
FOR IT.
ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:10.556
OF A TALKING TO PUBLICLY.
JONATHAN:

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.558
YOU ARE ACCOUNTABLE, A REMINDER
COMING OUT OF NEW ZEALAND.

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:13.559
SARAH HOUSE FROM WELLS FARGO
HERE TO TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:19.531
DATA. GETTING A PICTURE FOR THE
MOMENTUM COMING INTO 2026, WHAT

02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:24.536
DOES THIS ECONOMY LOOK LIKE?
SARAH:

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:27.539
I STILL THINK WE HAVE SOME
DECENT MOMENTUM, NOT NEARLY AS

02:07:27.539 --> 02:07:28.540
STRONG AS WE WERE LOOKING AT A
YEAR AGO BUT YOU ARE SEEING

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:32.544
CONSUMERS ARE STILL OUT THERE
SPENDING.

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:36.548
THE UNDERLYING PACE OF INCOME
GROWTH HAS BEEN A BIT OF A

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:37.549
CHALLENGE, WHICH IS THE JOBS
MARKET SLOWING, BUT YOU STILL

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:43.555
HAVE TRANSFER PAYMENTS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:45.557
CONSUMERS STILL HAVE THEIR JOBS
EVEN IF YOU ARE SEEING A MORE

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:48.527
SLUGGISH JOB MARKET.
WE ARE SEEING THAT FILTER THREE

02:07:48.527 --> 02:07:51.530
AND SPENDING.
WHILE YOU ARE SEEING SOME

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:53.532
UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY
PRESSURES BEGIN TO DISSIPATE,

02:07:53.532 --> 02:07:55.534
IT'S ONLY HAPPENING GRADUALLY
AS WE SAW WITH PPI NUMBERS THIS

02:07:55.534 --> 02:08:01.540 line:92%
MORNING. JONATHAN:

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:07.546
CITI WE HAD ON THE PROGRAM
EARLIER THIS MORNING.

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:09.548
THE ARGUMENT THAT THE
DISINFLATIONARY MOMENTUM WILL

02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:10.549
OPEN THE DOOR FOR RATE CUTS.
WHERE ARE YOU ON THE SAME

02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:15.554
ARGUMENT? SARAH:
I GENERALLY AGREE.

02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:20.526
WE HAVE TWO RATE CUTS AND OUR
FORECASTS WITH FURTHER

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:25.531
DISINFLATION.
PART OF THAT STORY, EVEN IF WE

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:28.534
ARE NOT GETTING BACK TO 2% THIS
YEAR, THE DIRECTION OF PROGRESS

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:32.538
WILL ENCOURAGE THE FED TO MOVE
TO A MORE NEUTRAL STANCE.

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:37.543
YOU STILL HAVE LINGERING
CONCERNS ABOUT THE JOB MARKET.

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:40.546
EVEN WITH DECEMBER'S
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE PAST

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:44.550
YEAR, OVER THE PAST THREE
YEARS, COMBINED THAT WITH THE

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:49.555
QUESTIONABLE PACE OF JOB GROWTH
WHERE WE ARE SEEING HIRING AT

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:55.527
MORE OR LESS A STANDSTILL,
THERE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FED

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.529
CAUTIOUS, TO RETURN POLICY TO A
STANCE THAT THEY ARE DECIDEDLY

02:08:57.529 --> 02:09:01.533
BELIEVING IT IS CLOSER TO
NEUTRAL.

02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:02.534
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE
THAT IS THAT MOST COMMITTEE

02:09:02.534 --> 02:09:07.539
MEMBERS WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE
NOT THERE YET. ANNMARIE:

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:09.541
THIS WAS NOVEMBER'S NUMBERS.
WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROM THE FACT

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:14.546
THAT THE DATA FEELS SO OUTDATED
AT THIS POINT? SARAH:

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:19.551
SOME DATA IS BETTER THAN NO
DATA, AND EVEN LATE DATA IS

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:26.558
BETTER THAN HOLES IN THE DATA.
THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS IN

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:32.231
TERMS OF HOW ROBUST THE DATA IS
GIVEN SAMPLING PERIODS SHIFTED,

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:36.902
SURVEY RESPONSE RATES DISRUPTED
BY THE NORMAL COURSE OF

02:09:36.902 --> 02:09:40.539
PROCEDURE.
WHEN WE ARE SEEING IS THE

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:42.541
INFLATION PICTURE IS DEFINITELY
NOT GETTING WORSE.

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:46.545
EVEN IF WE ARE SEEING SIGNS
FROM PPI THAT PRICE GROWTH

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:52.551 line:92%
REMAINS RATHER STICKY, WE ARE

02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:53.552
STILL SEEING THE CORE STILL
DOWN ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:57.556
FROM WHERE WE WERE A YEAR AGO.
WE ARE SEEING MORE CLEAR

02:09:57.556 --> 02:10:01.527
IMPROVEMENT FROM THE LATEST CPI
DATA.

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:03.529
IT IS STILL CONSISTENT WITH
THAT SLOW, GRADUAL DESCENT IN

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:09.535
INFLATION RESUMING. ANNMARIE:
I FEEL LIKE A BROKEN RECORD,

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:10.536
BUT WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WILL
START TO GET CLEAN READINGS

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:17.543
FROM THE GOVERNMENT DATA? SARAH:
CLOSER TO MARCH, PARTICULARLY

02:10:17.543 --> 02:10:19.545
WHEN IT COMES TO THE INFLATION
DATA WHERE YOU HAVE SOME OF THE

02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:23.549
SEASONALITY ISSUES TO GET
THROUGH, NOT JUST THE SHUTDOWN.

02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:24.550
YOU ARE IN JUST A VERY NOISY
PICTURE FOR THE INFLATION

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:29.555
PICTURE.
BY THE TIME WE GET THE MARCH

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:30.556
DATA, WHICH WILL NOT BE UNTIL
APRIL, THERE WILL STILL BE SOME

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:36.528
QUESTIONS AROUND THIS.
AT LEAST WE HAVE SOME DATA NOW

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:40.532
BUT I WOULD NOT SAY IT IS THE
CLEANEST DATA WE HAVE HAD, THE

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:43.535
CLEANEST BLOCK OF DATA THAT WE
LIKE TO BE MAKING FORECASTS ON,

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:47.539
POLICYMAKERS MAKING DECISIONS
ON. JONATHAN:

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:50.542
EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT
CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE.

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:58.550
HOW CREDIBLE ARE THOSE THREATS?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT INFLATION

02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.551
BASED EXPECTATIONS, DO YOU SEE
A CREDIBLE THREAT TO CENTRAL

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:04.556
BANK INDEPENDENCE SHOWING UP
ANYWHERE? SARAH:

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:07.526
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR MARCUS A
PRICE THAT IN RIGHT NOW.

02:11:07.559 --> 02:11:10.529
WE HAVE SEEN THE PRESSURE RAMP
UP, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:13.532
WE STILL HAVE A 19-MEMBER
COMMITTEE.

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:18.537
UNTIL YOU SEE A MUCH BIGGER
CHANGE IN THE COMMITTEE, YOU

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:22.541
WILL SEE POLICYMAKERS COME AS
WE HAVE SEEN JAY POWELL SAY

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:23.542
TIME AND AGAIN, THEY WILL PUT
THEIR HEADS DOWN AND DO THEIR

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:26.545
JOB.
THAT IS THE BEST WAY THEY CAN

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:29.548
DEMONSTRATE THAT INDEPENDENCE.
AS LONG AS WE SEE THAT PLAY

02:11:29.548 --> 02:11:35.554
OUT, YOU WILL NOT SEE A LOT OF
THAT IN THE MARKETS, EVEN IF IT

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:39.558
IS IN THE BACK OF THE LIGHT OF
A LOT OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:42.527
JONATHAN:
SARAH HOUSE OF WELLS FARGO.

02:11:42.527 --> 02:11:45.530
NOT TO UNDERPLAY THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CONVERSATION

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:49.534
WE ARE HAVING OVER THE LAST FEW
DAYS, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:51.536
MARKET'S JUDGMENT OF HOW
CREDIBLE THESE THREATS ARE,

02:11:51.536 --> 02:11:55.540
THEY SEEM TO BE A LOT OF FAITH
IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE

02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.409
FEDERAL RESERVE, RESILIENCE OF
THE INSTITUTION.

02:11:57.409 --> 02:12:01.113
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOND MARKET,
ESSENTIALLY UNMOVED IN THE FACE

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:04.549
OF THIS. ANNMARIE:
A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH

02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:06.551
YOU HAVE SENATORS AND
INDIVIDUALS IN CONGRESS WHO ARE

02:12:06.551 --> 02:12:08.553
SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH ANY SORT OF FED

02:12:08.553 --> 02:12:16.528 line:92%
PIC UNTIL THIS IS WRAPPED UP.

02:12:16.528 --> 02:12:19.531
THE SPEECH THAT PRESIDENT
WILLIAMS GAVE, HE WAS ASKED THE

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:20.532
QUESTION, WHY IS THE MARKET
SHRUGGING IT OFF, DO THEY NOT

02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:25.537
CARE? THE ANSWER WAS THE MARKET
DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE

02:12:25.537 --> 02:12:29.541
INFORMATION YET.
IF THAT IS STILL INDEPENDENT,

02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:34.546
SO THE MARKET IS PUSHING THIS
OFF TO SOMETHING ELSE, UNTIL

02:12:34.546 --> 02:12:40.552
THEY HAVE THE CREDIBILITY
SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED. JONATHAN:

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:43.555
10-YEAR BOND YIELDS, 4.1 FIVE,
DOWN BY TWO BASIS POINTS.

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:47.526
LET'S CROSS OVER TO VONNIE
QUINN FOR YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

02:12:47.559 --> 02:12:50.529
VONNIE:
RECAPPING THE DATA FROM MOMENTS

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:54.533
AGO, PPI INFLATION COMING IN
HIGHER THAN EXPECTED FOR

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:55.534
NOVEMBER, RISING 3%
YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARED TO

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:59.538
ESTIMATES OF 2.7%.
MONTH OVER MONTH NUMBERS WERE

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:04.543
UNCHANGED FOR PRICES EXCLUDING
FOOD AND ENERGY.

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:07.546
RETAIL SALES CAME IN HIGHER
THAN EXPECTED, RISING 0.6

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:13.552
PERCENT FROM OCTOBER COMPARED
TO THE ESTIMATE OF 0.5%.

02:13:13.552 --> 02:13:14.553
AMAZON IS LOOKING TO REDUCE
WHAT IT PAYS SUPPLIERS AHEAD OF

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:19.558
THAT POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT
TARIFF DECISION.

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:22.527
THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTED IN
THE TECH JOHN IS MOVING TO

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:23.528
REVERSE SOME OF THE MEASURES
USED TO EASE THE IMPACTS OF

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:28.533
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEVEES.
IN SPORTS, MIKE TOMLIN HAS

02:13:28.533 --> 02:13:32.537
STEPPED DOWN AS THE HEAD COACH
OF THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS.

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:37.542
HE HAD BEEN IN THE ROLE SINCE
2007, THE LONGEST TENURED HEAD

02:13:37.542 --> 02:13:43.548
COACH IN THE NFL.
HE FAILED TO WIN A PLAYOFF GAME

02:13:43.548 --> 02:13:47.552
ACROSS THE TEAM'S LAST SEVEN
APPEARANCES.

02:13:47.552 --> 02:13:51.556
IN HIS 19 YEARS, HE NEVER
FINISHED WITH A LOSING RECORD.

02:13:51.556 --> 02:13:56.528
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.
NEXT, CATCHING UP WITH THE

02:13:56.528 --> 02:13:57.529
CARLYLE COFOUNDER DAVID
RUBENSTEIN, PLUS YAHAIRA ANAND

02:13:57.529 --> 02:14:09.541 line:92%
WITH YOUR MORNING MOVERS.

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:26.725
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS EXCEEDINGLY CLEAR IS
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT

02:14:26.725 --> 02:14:30.729
LET THESE TO GO.
WE MAY END UP WITH THE DECISION

02:14:30.729 --> 02:14:35.734
TODAY THAT RULES AGAINST
CERTAIN TARIFFS, THOSE IMPOSED

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:36.735
FOR TRADE DEFICITS, AND RETAINS
OTHER TARIFFS.

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:43.742
IT WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO
TAKE SOME TIME TO ANALYZE

02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:44.743
WHATEVER THE SUPREME COURT PUTS
OUT BEFORE COMPANY DECIDE WHAT

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:50.715
TO DO NEXT. JONATHAN:
THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE TRADE

02:14:50.715 --> 02:14:52.717
OFFICIAL WEIGHING IN ON
POTENTIALLY GETTING A RULING ON

02:14:52.717 --> 02:14:54.719
THE LIBERATION DAY TARIFFS
ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT LAST

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:55.720
APRIL.
COUNTING DOWN TO THE OPENING

02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:00.725
BELL.
EQUITY FUTURES SLIGHTLY SOFTER

02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:06.731
THIS MORNING, DOWN BY 0.5%.
DOWN 0.6% ON THE NASDAQ.

02:15:06.731 --> 02:15:13.738
FINANCIALS AND BANKS IN FOCUS.
YAHAIRA: WE START THERE.

02:15:13.738 --> 02:15:18.743
A LOT OF WHIPS SONG ALONG THESE
BANK STOCKS.

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:21.713
WELLS FARGO SHARES ARE DOWN 2.5
PERCENT AFTER HIGHER SEVERANCE

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:24.716
COSTS AND A MISS ON NET
INTEREST INCOME HIT PROFITS.

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:29.721
BANK OF AMERICA SHARES WERE
POSITIVE EARLIER, NOW DOWN ONE

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:32.724
POINT 8% DESPITE IT BEATING ON
MOST MEASURES.

02:15:32.724 --> 02:15:36.728
EQUITY TRADERS POSTING THEIR
BEST FOR QUARTER EVER.

02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:41.733
CITI, THE ONLY ONE IN THE GREEN
AMONG THE BANKS REPORTED, UP

02:15:41.733 --> 02:15:45.737
ONE POINT 8% AFTER REPORTING A
BIG JUMP IN DEALMAKING REVENUE.

02:15:45.737 --> 02:15:49.741
84% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
GOLD, SILVER, COPPER ALL

02:15:49.741 --> 02:15:52.744
HEADING RECORD HIGHS.
THAT IS POWERING MINING STOCKS

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:58.717 line:92%
THIS MORNING.

02:15:58.717 --> 02:15:59.718
THERE COULD GOLD UP ONE .9
PERCENT. FIRST MAJESTIC SILVER

02:15:59.718 --> 02:16:06.725 line:92%
CORPORATION IS UP 3.5%.

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:08.727
PALO ALTO NETWORKS SHARES ARE
DOWN 1.5 PERCENT ON A REPORT

02:16:08.727 --> 02:16:10.729
THAT CHINA HAS BANNED THE USE
OF ITS SOFTWARE OVER NATIONAL

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:15.734
SECURITY CONCERNS.
THIS IS PART OF A BIGGER BAND

02:16:15.734 --> 02:16:20.739
INVOLVING A DOZEN U.S.
AND ISRAELI CYBER SECURITY

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:21.740
FIRMS. THIS COMES AS TENSIONS
BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S.

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:25.744
HAVE HEIGHTENED.
CHINA IS PUSHING ITS COMPANIES

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:30.715
TO USE DOMESTIC PROVIDERS.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:36.721
LET'S TURN BACK TO THE BIG
STORY OF THE WEEK SO FAR, JAMIE

02:16:36.721 --> 02:16:37.722
DIMON MORNING THE DOJ SUBPOENAS
OF THE FED RISK UNDERMINING THE

02:16:37.722 --> 02:16:45.730
CENTRAL BANKS INDEPENDENCE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDING.

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:48.733
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS FINE WHEN I'M
DOING.

02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:49.734
WE SHOULD HAVE LOWER RATES.
JAMIE DIMON PROBABLY WANT

02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:50.735
HIGHER RATES.
MAYBE HE MAKES MORE MONEY THAT

02:16:50.735 --> 02:16:56.741 line:92%
WAY. JONATHAN:

02:16:56.741 --> 02:17:00.712
DAVID RUBENSTEIN JOINS US NOW
FOR MORE. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:17:00.745 --> 02:17:03.715
YOU HAVE KNOWN CHAIRMAN POWELL
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

02:17:03.715 --> 02:17:07.719
IT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE HIM
ENGAGE IN SUCH A PUBLIC WAY ON

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:08.720
SUCH A HOT ISSUE LIKE HE DID ON
SUNDAY EVENING.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.822 line:92%
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:16.061
&gt;&gt; HE WORKED AT CARLYLE FOR
EIGHT YEARS, A VERY SMART

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:19.731
PERSON.
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, HE DIDN'T

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:21.733
RESPOND TO ANY OF THE
COMPLAINTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:25.737
HAD ABOUT HIM.
IT SHOWED ENORMOUS RESTRAINT.

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:29.741
I DON'T THINK I COULD'VE HAD
THAT KIND OF RESTRAINT.

02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:34.713
FINALLY WHEN THE POSSIBILITY OF
CRIMINAL ACTION AGAINST HIM WAS

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:35.714
PUT ON THE TABLE, HE RESPONDED
IN A WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD

02:17:35.714 --> 02:17:39.718
RESPOND.
ANYBODY THAT HAS THAT KIND OF

02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:43.722
THREAT OVER THEM IS PROBABLY
GOING TO RESPOND.

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:45.724
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD
THREATS OF CRIMINAL ACTION

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:48.727
AGAINST HIM, HE RESPONDED
PUBLICLY.

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:51.730
I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT JAY
POWELL RESPONDED THAT WAY.

02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:53.732
JONATHAN:
IN YOUR OPINION, DO YOU THINK

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:57.736
THERE IS A GENUINE THREAT TO
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL

02:17:57.736 --> 02:18:03.742
RESERVE? DAVID:
ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR IS

02:18:03.742 --> 02:18:06.745
SUBPOENAS ISSUED, NO DECISION
BY A GRAND JURY, PROSECUTOR.

02:18:06.745 --> 02:18:08.713
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN.

02:18:08.713 --> 02:18:14.719
MY GUESS IS PROBABLY NOTHING
WOULD HAPPEN IN THE END.

02:18:14.719 --> 02:18:15.720
THE REACTION OF THE FINANCIAL
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN FAIRLY

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:21.726
UNANIMOUS.
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYONE THAT

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:24.729
SAYS THIS IS A GOOD IDEA, LET'S
MAKE THE FED LESS INDEPENDENT.

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:28.733
MY VIEW IS THAT, LIKE MANY
THINGS IN WASHINGTON, ONE DAY

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:33.738
WONDER STORIES.
THIS WILL PROBABLY GO AWAY.

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:34.739
OF COURSE, I'M NOT THE PERSON
THAT HAS SUBPOENAS AGAINST ME,

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:40.712
SO IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SAY THAT.
I WOULD EXPECT AN INTELLIGENT

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:42.714
PERSON THAT LOOKS AT JAY POWELL
AND HIS INTEGRITY OVER MANY

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:46.718
YEARS WOULD CONCLUDE THAT THIS
IS AN HONEST PERSON.

02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:49.721
THERE ARE ALWAYS COST OVERRUNS
IN ANY BUILDING YOU HAVE.

02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:53.725
I DON'T KNOW THAT COST OVERRUNS
ARE CRIMINAL.

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:57.729
ANY BUILDING IN WASHINGTON THAT
IS BUILT HAS COST OVERRUNS.

02:18:57.729 --> 02:18:58.730
THE WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM,
READING REPORTS, THERE SEEMS TO

02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:05.737
BE COST OVERRUNS THERE, AS WELL.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE COST OVERRUNS

02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:08.740
IN BUILDING BUILDINGS.
I DON'T THINK HE IS A

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:11.743
CONSTRUCTION MANAGER OR IS
MAKING MONEY FROM THE COST

02:19:11.743 --> 02:19:12.744
OVERRUNS, SO I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING CRIMINAL IN MY VIEW

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:17.716
BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR.
ANNMARIE:

02:19:17.716 --> 02:19:21.720
HAVING KNOWN JAY POWELL WELL,
DO YOU THINK HE WILL STAY ON AT

02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:26.725
THE FED TO SERVE OUT HIS TERM
AS A GOVERNOR UNTIL 2028? DAVID:

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.727
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR HIM.
I WOULD SAY HE HAS DONE A GREAT

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:33.732
JOB SERVING THE COUNTRY AS
CHAIR.

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:36.735
AS CHAIR, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY
RECESSIONS.

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:39.738
HE HAS HAD TO INCREASE AND
DECREASE INTEREST RATES.

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:42.741
NORMALLY, WHEN YOU DO THAT, AT
SOME POINT YOU GET A RECESSION.

02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:49.714
IT IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HIM
BUT I THINK HE PROBABLY FEELS

02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:51.716
HE HAS DONE A SERVICE TO THE
COUNTRY, DONE HIS SERVICE

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:55.720
BEFORE IN THE GEORGE HERBERT
WALKER BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:58.723
IF IT WERE ME, I WOULD SAY,
I'VE DONE MY JOB AS CHAIRMAN, I

02:19:58.723 --> 02:20:06.731
WILL DO SOMETHING ELSE, BUT I
CANNOT SPEAK FOR HIM. ANNMARIE:

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:09.734
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HIS TENURE
OF THE FED, A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:12.737
KNOW HIM AS MR. TRANSITORY.
DOES THIS RESHAPE HIS LEGACY

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:15.740
NOW, THE VIDEO THAT HE PUT OUT?
DAVID:

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:18.743
SINCE THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED
TO ANY CHAIR OF THE FED BEFORE,

02:20:18.743 --> 02:20:21.713
THIS IS PROBABLY GETTING A LOT
OF ATTENTION.

02:20:21.713 --> 02:20:24.716
I SUSPECT PEOPLE GO DOWN IN
HISTORY AS A FED CHAIR WHO

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:30.722
EXPLAINED WHAT THE FED WAS
LIKELY TO DO IN A REASONABLY

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:33.725
PRECISE TERMS BEFORE HE DID IT,
AND THEN 30 MINUTES AFTER, HE

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:38.730
WOULD EXPLAIN IT IN ENGLISH.
MANY FED CHAIRS TALK IN FED

02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:39.731
SPEAK, SO YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, AND

02:20:39.731 --> 02:20:42.734
THAT'S INTENTIONAL.
ALAN GREENSPAN SAID HE DIDN'T

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:48.740
WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS
THINKING.

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:52.744
JAY POWELL IS USING KING'S
ENGLISH AND HE SAYS THINGS

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:54.712
PRETTY PRECISELY AND TELLS YOU
WITHIN 30 MINUTES THE THINGS

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:57.715
THEY DID AND WHY THEY DID IT.
I THINK HE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:58.716
FOR THE FED.
AGAIN, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY

02:20:58.716 --> 02:21:04.722
RECESSIONS.
HE WAS NOT THE ONE WHO SAID

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:07.725
LET'S INJECT $5 TRILLION INTO
THE ECONOMY TO DEAL WITH COVID.

02:21:07.725 --> 02:21:11.729
IT WAS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND PRESIDENT BIDEN THAT $5

02:21:11.729 --> 02:21:14.732
TRILLION WAS INJECTED INTO THE
ECONOMY WITH NO CORRESPONDING

02:21:14.732 --> 02:21:18.736
TAX INCREASES.
OF COURSE YOU'LL GET INFLATION.

02:21:18.736 --> 02:21:23.741
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A BIG
PART OF HIS LEGACY.

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:25.743
HE DID WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO BE
DONE.

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:28.713
NOW INFLATION IS IN REASONABLE
SHAPE.

02:21:28.713 --> 02:21:33.718
IT IS NOT TO PERCENT, BUT IT IS
ALSO NOT AT 8%.

02:21:33.718 --> 02:21:36.721
THE 2% TARGET MAY HAVE BEEN A
LITTLE AMBITIOUS, MAYBE IT WILL

02:21:36.721 --> 02:21:37.722
GET THERE, BUT INFLATION IS NOT
THE MAIN THING THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:43.728
TALKING ABOUT IN AMERICA.
JONATHAN:

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:46.731
THE INFLATION RATE IS TOLERABLE
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS

02:21:46.731 --> 02:21:47.732
COUNTRY BUT THE PRICE LEVEL IS
UNAFFORDABLE.

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:52.737
WE SEE THAT BEING ADDRESSED BY
THE PRESIDENT.

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:54.739
CITIGROUP HAS BEEN DIRECT ABOUT
SOME OF THE PROPOSALS COMING

02:21:54.739 --> 02:21:56.741
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, SAYING
THE INTEREST RATE CAP WOULD

02:21:56.741 --> 02:21:59.744
REDUCE ACCESS TO CREDIT.
HAS CREDIT GOT A TARGET ON ITS

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:04.716
BACK THIS YEAR? DAVID:
ALWAYS EASY TO BEAT UP ON BIG

02:22:04.716 --> 02:22:06.718
BUSINESS.
THAT IS SOMETHING THE AVERAGE

02:22:06.718 --> 02:22:10.722
PERSON IS NOT HAPPY WITH FROM
TIME TO TIME.

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:14.726
POLITICIANS AND POLITICAL
FIGURES FOR THE LAST 200 YEARS

02:22:14.726 --> 02:22:15.727
IN AMERICA HAVE FOUND BEATING
UP ON WALL STREET OR

02:22:15.727 --> 02:22:19.731
BUSINESSPEOPLE PEOPLE A VERY
INVITING THING TO DO.

02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:21.733
NO ONE HAS EVER LOST AN
ELECTION BY BEATING UP ON WALL

02:22:21.733 --> 02:22:26.738
STREET.
BEATING UP ON WALL STREET HAS

02:22:26.738 --> 02:22:27.739
NEVER FORCED ANYONE TO LOSE AN
ELECTION. IT IS A TRIED AND TRUE

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:33.745 line:92%
TECHNIQUE. ANNMARIE:

02:22:33.745 --> 02:22:35.713
DOES THAT GIVE WALL STREET
PAUSE NOW, THAT THE PRESIDENT

02:22:35.713 --> 02:22:40.718
IS APPARENTLY TEXTING ON A
REGULAR BASIS WITH ZOHRAN

02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:42.720
MAMDANI, HAVING CALLS WITH
ELIZABETH WARREN ON ISSUES LIKE

02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:47.725
THIS, 10 PERCENT CAP ON CREDIT
CARDS? DAVID:

02:22:47.725 --> 02:22:49.727
WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE
ENTIRE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, THEY

02:22:49.727 --> 02:22:52.730
ARE USED TO PRESIDENT FROM
DOING THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:56.734
THEY UNDERSTAND THIS IS HIS
TECHNIQUE OF COMMUNICATING.

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:57.735
THEY DON'T CRITICIZE IT, DON'T
SAY THAT IT IS GREAT, IT IS

02:22:57.735 --> 02:23:02.740
JUST HOW HE COMMUNICATES.
EACH PERSON WILL HAVE TO MAKE

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:08.713 line:92%
THEIR OWN JUDGMENT. JONATHAN:

02:23:08.713 --> 02:23:09.714
ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND
OPINION, PARTICULARLY ON THIS

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:16.721
TOPIC. DAVID RUBENSTEIN, THE
COCHAIRMAN OF CARLYLE.

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:20.725
9:00 EASTERN TIME, THE LATEST
EPISODE OF THE DAVID RUBENSTEIN

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:22.927
SHOW, PEER TO PEER
CONVERSATIONS, TAKING PLACE

02:23:22.927 --> 02:23:26.731
WITH BILL BROWDER. ANNMARIE:
HE MADE A TON OF MONEY IN THE

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:29.734
1990'S IN RUSSIA, HAS A LOT TO
SAY ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON

02:23:29.734 --> 02:23:34.739
RIGHT NOW IN THIS WAR WITH
UKRAINE.

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:36.741
ONE HOUR AWAY ALMOST, REMEMBER,
WE MAY GET A TARIFF DECISION

02:23:36.741 --> 02:23:41.713
FROM THE SUPREME COURT.
ALL EYES ON THAT. JONATHAN:

02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:43.715
WE WILL SEE IF WE GET ONE THIS
WEEK.

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:48.720
ANTICIPATING MORE EARNINGS TO
COME. MORGAN STANLEY AND GOLDMAN

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.723
SACHS TOMORROW.
IN DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, THE

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:55.727
PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE WORLD
ECONOMIC FORUM.

02:23:55.727 --> 02:23:56.728
APPARENTLY THE BIG PUSH WILL BE
ON AFFORDABILITY.

02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:58.730
AN INTERESTING TIME OVER THE
NEXT WEEK FOR THIS COUNTRY AND

02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:05.737 line:92%
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

02:24:05.737 --> 02:24:09.741
TOMORROW, NELA RICHARDSON AND
AIRA MALIK.

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:17.281
THE OPENING BELL IS 34 MINUTES
AWAY.
